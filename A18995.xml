         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all former ages to this preſent time, in which we now liue, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of writers was neuer doubted of, whether abſtinence or fulneſſe did ouercharge or moſte offend bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily health: And neuer yet found out to the contrarie, but that euery degree of the world, haue both felt and confeſſed, eyther of them in their exceſſe, were ſharpe and expreſſe enemies both to the lawe of nature, and bodilie temperance of this life. Yet ſeeing both the learned as the vnlearned, although with difference, had rather offend both the ſound as the ſicke, with the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſaturitie, then with ſparing abſtinence, for which cauſe in miniſtring of medicines it were needefull to ſhewe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience on eyther ſide. A full and ſatiſfied bodie is chiefly preſerued, fortified and continued with ſtrength and flouriſhing liuelihood by wholeſome Iulepes and ſuch like, clarified poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to the property of the ſickneſſe. And a pennurious bodie is weakened, puniſhed, exhauſted, and oftentimes peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth in moſt ſharpe agonies, except it be comforted, preſerued and renewed by ſome reſtible electuaries and ſuch like. And ſurely ſuch bodies which are perfect vnder temperance and ſtrength, if at anie time they be diſtempered with griefe or ſicknes, may forthwith be tempered, ſeaſoned &amp; ſalued by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinable help: for medicine moſt of al reioyceth to ſhew forth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer &amp; work high effects in a ſtrong nature. Certainly <hi>Auycen</hi> hath a very ſecret and metaphiſicall iudgement heerem, who commandeth that nature and medicine, whether in ſtrength or weakeneſſe, be alwayes vnited, and neyther in health nor ſickneſſe do diſſociat, but ſolutiue medicines, eſpecially ought to be of diuers natures, conuenient and agreeable for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, in euery ſeuerall age, and naturall complexion, with their iuſt and comprehenſible maner of dyet to be in like ſorte

            <p>Furthermore, ſet not the blind ignorance of many vnſkilfull practitioners be herein pertermitted, who ſhould with moderate cheriſhing help nature, doe with immoderate chaſing hinder and inflame thoſe hote bodies which were before infected by the moſt hot ſeaſons of the yeare.

               </gap>gent, and the ſtomacke more ſharpe. Then next thereunto: it were not good, that emptineſſe or abſtinence were vſed, but to haue ſuſtinance in continuall practiſe, not of the groſeſt, but of the choſen ſortes of meates: for if the poores thorow emptineſſe, be left open and vnſhut, for want of nouriſhment, to increſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bloud and ſtrength, are not onely in danger againe to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but doe ſtain, foyzen and infect others. Then howe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a thing is it, in beholding ſome buſie medlers, repayring vnto ſicke pacientes, doe not in anie perfect ſkill, diſtinguiſh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſeaſe, whether there be any crud and rawe matter, or concockt ſetled in ſome part of the body: or whether the diſeaſe conſiſt and ſtand at a ſtay, or increaſe: or whether nature be of any forcible power in the body or no: but without ſearching the cauſe or vnderſtanding the matter of the ſickneſſe, doe preferre their owne hazard, and exaſperating the diſeaſe, eyther with fulſome medicine, or groſſe nouriſhment, ſtuffing their ſicke bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, eyther by entiſement or force. And whereas before they had ſome abilitie, appetite forthwith waxeth wearie and lothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in them. <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth that the perfecteſt rule to<note place="margin">The patient might bee nouriſhed and meaſured vnder appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</note> health, is to repreſſe a cold ſickneſſe by nouriſhing foode, ſo that nouriſhment and appetite agree. He giueth no ſuch large liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the hote diſeaſes: notwithſtanding, manie haue aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the greateſt heate and trauell of diſeaſes, not onely to purge the bodie, to cut vaines, and let bloud, but alſo haue ſtife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their bodyes, rather with inchaunted meates, then wholſome medicines: and for that nature canot diſgeſt ſuch groſſe imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſtand in ſo hard a ſtay of recouerie, as commonly in the end become immedicable and mortall. <hi>Cornelius Celſus,</hi> a moſt excellent writer, affirmeth that a ſatictie and fulneſſe of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5375:6"/> meate in ſickneſſe, is neuer profitable, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> therefore to auoyd eyther miſchiefe, doth appertaine to ſingular ſkill. The ſafeſt and directeſt paſſage, for the vnſkilfull phiſition herein, is, that the patient rather be continued with a thinne diet, then vnordered fulneſſe, ſo that he be not ouermuch extenuated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> both conſenting together affirme that faſting and thinne diet, doe ſurely and ſecretly mortifie ſuch diſeaſes, which happen vnder ſurfet, or anie other vnordered and glottonous meates, and a ſtaying of manie ſharpe diſeaſes that followe thereupon. And ſome high clarkes holde opinion that abſtinence ought in time of ſickneſſe to be guided with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and all medicines to be congruent and martched vnder perfect conſtitution, and of double operation, which is aſwell to comforte nature, as to expell the diſeaſe: for if the ſubſtance of ſtrength be diminiſhed, and the malice of the diſeaſe increaſed, appetite and nature, are eſtranged and variable within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For nature manie times deſireth thoſe thinges which appetite abhorreth: the reaſon is, for that appetite is ouercloyed with diuerſitie of meates, and interchaunge of medicines, that both the ſtomacke and all the luſtes of the body inceſſantly are purſued, fatigated, and improuidently throwne vpon many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extremities.</p>
            <p>Therefore vnder theſe meane conſtitutions: whereas tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie and appetite flouriſh and beare ſway, there is a good and happie expectation: as if the vitall partes be not wearied, the diſeaſe may be cured, and the decayed ſtrength by little and little reſtored. Surely when the heart, thorow ouer great abſtinence, is languiſhed, the ſtomacke cloyed, and the liuer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated and forſaken of the wholſome bloud. All thinges thereby haue loſt their naturall and proper courſe, that forthwith opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet Auycene affyrmeth, that medicine and diet in ſickneſſe, is brooked according to the ſtrength and weakneſſe of ſtomacke.

            <p>Many times theſe diets are ioyned to vnſkilfull practitioners as high iuſt plagues for wicked offences, both for that by them naturall heate is extinguiſhed, appetite deſtroyed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection diſcoloured.</p>
            <p>Theſe diets ought to be tempered to this good effect, as that drines and humiditie are to be vnited of one ſubtill coniunction and propertie. And therefore <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith, that drie, ſubtil and hungrie airs are moſt beſt for theſe diets, if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plections be thicke and groſſe: But low and vaporous ayres are moſt preſeruing of thin pearcing bodies and open diets.</p>
            <p>And further ſaith, that interchanges of diets and ayres, for winter and ſommer by ſeuerall habitations, produce health and long life. But Manardus affyrmeth that commixed bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long liued vpon high grounds, open ayres and full diets. Therefore it is a moſt excellent contemplation for euerie man to caſt vp his ſences, and perfectly find vnder what temperance hee liueth, for the wholſome regiment of health, and therewithall to way his bodily complection: alwaies directing his diet, habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and courſe of lyuing according to the ſame. And laſtlie, let euery man beware of varietie and groſneſſe of meates, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and groſnes of diets which ingender and bring foorth vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie and groſnes of diſeaſes.</p>

Yet there is great diſagreement among the latter writers, that if the diſeaſe be vnualurable ineſtat or faſhion, how can the accidents of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be valurable or ſharpe: and if putrifaction, or corruption be moſt great and forcible in eſtat, how can concoction be moſt perfect, for concoction is contrarie to putrifaction. Howſoeuer it doth heere fall out by controuerſie, the ſureſt ſtay vppon the ſicke patient is, when the diſeaſe is ſetled, the infection is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for then the medicine more certainly expelleth the cauſe.</p>
               <p>And therefore beholde that all diſeaſſes, breake forth their malice, by depending vpon ſpeciall ſeaſons of the yeare: So that there is a double kind of offenſiue matter in all feuers, one which can neuer be corrected, and the other which by little and little ſetleth, and at length thereby expelled. And yet there be ſome moſte dangerous feuers, ſo alienated, and eſtranged in their natures, as neyther will rypen of themſelues to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deuoyded, nor yet be altered by any medicine, to become certaine.</p>

               <p>Surely a thinne dyet is beſt approoued in the opinion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uycen:</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:5375:22"/> that is, when the diſeaſe conſiſteth and ſtayeth in one courſe towardes health: But if the diſeaſe in forceable aſſault runneth forward without ſtay, then all dyets are ſubſtracted, vntill the nature of the diſeaſe appeare more open and perfect. For the bodie hauing eſcaped theſe and ſuch like perils of ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is like a wayfaring man hauing paſſed a tedious and hard iourney, through long faſting, and much labour, deſireth foode: So theſe bodies ouerpaſſing and preuenting variable hazardes by fatigable wreſtling, and painefull induring both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, increaſe with the eſtate and perfection of the diſeaſe, are like a ſtrong captaine, after conqueſt and victorie, deſireth quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, reſt, meate, and ſuſtinance. And yet many of theſe diſeaſes, recouered both by good ordinance of medicine, and wholeſome foode, haue returned backe to their olde dangers, and not ſtaied their courſe before deathe. All which falleth out, both becauſe there was ſome diſordered ſurfet before health ſetled in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the diſeaſe not quite rooted out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> ſaith, that if the bodye fall into preſent miſgouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, after that it hath bene recouered from ſharpe ſickneſſes, eſpecially inflammatiue diſeaſes, and before nature be reſtored to her preſtinat and potentiall eſtate and dignitie, death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commiſſeration inſulteth ouer life. And therefore he aduiſeth all men vniuerſally to ſettle nature, to ſharpen the ſtomacke, to ſhut the poores, and to entertaine ſleepe and quiet reſt, after ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, before they expooſe their body to any hard practiſe. Now theſe perfect canons, holden by generall conſent haue confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ouerthrowne the controuerſies of new writers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired vnto their antient and former ſeparation of diſeaſes, and ſecretly therewithall holde backe, and inwardly contayne their knowledge and counſell, touching ſimple diſeaſes, As though no ſuch thing appertaine vnto them: But largely comprehend the eſtate of theſe inflammatiue feuers in eyther of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures vnder one generall method for remedie to eyther of them: ſo that theſe diſeaſes haue diuers natures and operations, aſwel in their accidentes as in their concoction. And many times it ſo falleth out, that medicine altereth and ſetleth them, not onely to concoction, but alſo to be of an nature: whereas before they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:5375:23"/> were in their accidentes, variable, and diuers in their courſe and propertie. Touching the difference of theſe ſimple and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded feuers, I cannot finde no direct agreement, betweene <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in his book, <hi>de ratione victus,</hi> &amp; other writers, but <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Leonard Fuchſins,</hi> doe conſent, and with a true report ſound out, that all diſeaſes happening in the ſpring, ought to be vnder a moderate dyet in their beginning, becauſe nature is then moſt occupyed in digeſting raw flegmatike hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours congeſted the winter before, and by the naturall aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud, painefully diuerteth from common courſe. And alſo the bodye which is repleniſhed with humoures, is in the ſpring ſeaſon more troubled, then anie other time.</p>
               <p>But touching thoſe diſeaſes which fall out in ſommer, thinne dyet is then moſt meeteſt: for that both naturall and vnnaturall heate, exceede moyſtneſſe, and thoſe diſeaſes which then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, are moſt apteſt to inflame.</p>
               <p>But all thoſe diſeaſes which happen in Autume, meate is meaſured according to the diſeaſe: for no perfect dyet (ſayth <hi>Fuchſins</hi>) can be preſcribed, for that diſeaſes are then of diuers properties and contagions, And therefore to be meaſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phiſitians ſkill, knowledge and diſcretion. So alſo ſuche diſeaſes which fall out in winter, are furthered or hindered according to the ſeaſonableneſſe, or vnſeaſonableneſſe of the time. For moyſt foggy winters ingender corrupt diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the body to the vttermoſt: And naturall whether of froſts and ſnowe approoue and ſearch the body eyther to great wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of much health, or els to ſpeedie death: therefore <hi>Fuchſins</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hypocrates</hi> generallie and deeply ſpeaketh of all feauers, eyther ſimple or compound: that firſt the diſeaſe is vnſetled, and vncertainly roueth in the bodye: and next, for that it dooth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with paynfull trauels, difficultlie wraſtleth, ſkyrmiſheth and trauelleth, either to ſettle and poſſeſſe ſome one part of the body, or after the ſpyrituall partes poſſeſſed, inuadeth all the partes of the body to deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Herein is it manifeſtly prooued, that in the beginning of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes nature hath no need of ſuch nouriſhments: for if appetite were gredy and deſirous thereof, yet not able to beare that which is wiſhed and lingred vpon. For whoſoeuer infarceth and inforceth nature in the firſt entrance of euerie ſuch ſicknes, both cheriſheth the diſeaſe, weakeneth and defoyleth nature.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Theſe rules and reaſons proceede from men of great coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, of ſound and vpright iudgement, repugning the wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and erronious interpretations and opinions of certaine newe writers, who hauing ſet open their ſhoppe of counterfect practiſes in defrauding the good conſtitutions of heath in mans body, who in the beginning of ſimple feuers in place of a gracil and thin diet, haue conſtituted and put in place a free and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull diet.</p>

Surely <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſomewhat bendeth to the ſecond controuerſie, that in the increaſe of al ſimple feuers, a competent diet is moſt meeteſt, ſo that if the diſeaſe doo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the increaſe, or forſheweth any ſimilie end, either by ripeneſſe to ceaſe, or els take ſafe degrees to eſtate: Then the Phiſitian hath full power ouer the diſeaſe, eyther to recouer health, or els to ſtay the patient from large and ſtrong ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Briſſotus</hi> and <hi>Lionicius</hi> doo ſay, if in the eſtate of ſimple feuers, ſuſtenance bee denied to the patient becauſe of the ſtrength of the diſeaſe, then what ieopardie are thoſe paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes put into in their time of eſtate, when inflamations and accidentes together yeeld no place to reſt, their bodies beeing ſtrenghened with nutrimentall ſuſtenance, doo continue the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe

               <p>Hereby all patientes may perceiue, that all diſeaſes within the knowledge and helpe of man, are vnder lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Therefore whoſoeuer ſhall either violate or miſtake theſe lawes and ordinances, offendeth both the ſicke patient and his owne conſcience.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, if the ſicke Patient will not bee ordered, but rebell againſt this wholſome gouernment, preferring both his owne wilfull minde and reaſon before the ſounde and perfect counſell of the Phiſitian, Let him be adiudged guiltie of his owne death and diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

The hart is the inſtrument of life, the liuer the inſtrument of blood, the which of neceſſity are hot and moiſt: and ſo from thencefoorth there are certaine inſtruments of neceſſitie, ſome cold, ſome hot, ſome moyſt, and ſome drie: if any one of them at any time do bend or writh aſide from theſe iuſt temperature, their actiue qualitie muſt be diſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fall away therewith, for that the inſtrument which lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſame, is decaied.

               <p>And the rather becauſe all bodies haue a coniunction of the foure elementes, otherwiſe choller which is hot, drie, and colde, cannot ſerue the body in perfect nature and operation, for that vnnaturall choller corrupteth the whole body.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, as the foure humours are ſeperated one from another, in ſeueral eſtates and conſtitutions, ſo ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which are inſigned vnder any one of theſe humors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moderated one by an other, vntill there be a iudicial temperance raigning ouer all the wholl members: for although any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument were of neceſſitie cold, yet it is not conuenient ſo to be in the higheſt degree, for that certaine immixt elementes doo want the temperance of the ſecond qualitie. Now if ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe inſtruments were by this means moſt righteous and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, they ought not to be tempered on ſome one behalfe, but on euery behalfe: for no inſtrument can bee meete, whereas if any part thereof be vnmeete. And for this cauſe it is not onely a ſeemely ſight, that theſe elements after their greateſt portions, ſhould be groſly mingled in a myxt body, but that in the whole they become perfectly vnited, and that there be no want in any part thereof.</p>
               <p>Therefore as diuers elements are ſo mixed in one body, as that there is a ful ſeruice of al the members one to another.

               <p>This verily proueth that one element is faſhioned with another, ſo that all the elementes are of equall power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie one with another.

                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith, that in Autume there is a contrary motion of the Elementes in all ſuperiour cauſes, ſo in theſe inferiour cauſes there is alſo a chaungeableneſſe in all things: as from moyſtneſſe and greeneſſe, to ripeneſſe and rottennes, thorow which diſtemperance many thinges doe drawe ſtrange vapours of the aire into their qualitie, whereby many infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe corrupt and take holde of the body, in gendring vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

And after the diſſolution of this ouerraging heate, the north groweth to a moſt extreame vapour of colde about the noone ſeaſon. This may eaſily be gathered hereof, that the oppoſite poyntes of the north and the ſouth, hauing ſtrangely and diuerſly altered both their properties and courſes, the inferiour cauſes are ſo poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in a corrupt degree, as that ouerraging peſtilences are inkindled in ſuch like ſeaſons, and there ſhalbe perceiued great lightes and furious flames of heate ariſe in thoſe partes of the north, all which foreſheweth exceſſiue gluttes in the vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable aboundance of raine the winter following.</p>

They are men compounded of moſte excellent diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and for that they are of yellow whitiſh haire like flax, much good ſpeach is vſed of them, both by <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Dyoſcondes:</hi> they indure health ſtrongly, and doe reſiſt and beare out the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſickeneſſe familiarlie, withſtand the furie of accidentall diſeaſes, (called infections) moſt ſtifly, and the rather by reaſon of the varietie of their permixion and confuſed humours.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, for that we are diſtinctly to handle not onely the conſtitution of mans body, but chiefly the ſeuerall complexion, vnder which euery man is gouerned: therefore are we next to conſider of two ſortes of melancholicke men, of the which one kinde hath a helpefull humour and is appropriat to nature, the other is improper, or rather vnnaturall. The diſeaſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke perſon, is ingendred of two parts: of which one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into bloud, and poſſeſſeth the vaines, and the other is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into the ſpleane. It is profitable if the bloud thereof be thicke, whereas it was before thinne, watriſh and weake, being ſo conuerted doth muche ſtrengthen all the members of mans bodie.</p>
               <p>There is a melancholious humor ingendred vpon the liuer, which ſimple is neyther hote nor colde, but abſolutely drie and cold. And as <hi>Galen</hi> reporteth <hi>Socrates to be</hi> a melancholicke perſon, and a man of a thin bloud, by reaſon he had no actiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in heat, &amp; of a rough ſkin, becauſe continuall vapours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſtomack moued intentiue coldneſſe, becauſe the comfortable bloud did not freely at all times returne to proper courſe, his bones, mouth and braine were drie, and his ſtomacke feeble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Socrates</hi> was a melancholike perſon on the worſt part, both for that the liuer bloud was not perfect, neyther had free and open paſſage or recourſe vnto the vaynes, or yet was temperately conueyed vnto the ſpleane, in which places bloud ſhould be plentifull, vigent and nutrimental, and by which meanes all melancholious ſuperfluitie ſhould be expelled.</p>

For as it ſeemeth the foure elementes are commixed within the comprehenſion of the ſame waight: And as fire hath his naturall qualitie, and actiue motion with the other elementes: ſo if there be a greater portion of fire then earth, ſurely heate with a preheminent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſurpaſſeth coldneſſe.<note place="margin">Hipocrates is miſſenſed or miſtooke.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There are many which deſpiſe <hi>Hypocrates</hi> in his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſines, altogether miſſenſing his doctrine of heate, not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſimply heate, but a hot body, that is to ſay, the breath and bloud of the body. And doctor <hi>Meaſues</hi> ſayth, that children haue more breath and bloud, according to the proportion of their body, then others of higher age: that euen as a fire of greene woode burneth moſte ſtrongly and vehemently, ſo the heate of the children, (according to naturall meaſure and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance) ouerpaſſe higher ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leoncenus</hi> ſayth, neyther the one, nor the other ſtand with trueth, becauſe both ſortes are of one and the ſame degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to proportion. But <hi>Galen</hi> by the way plainely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth children to haue more heate: not becauſe heate is in them more intentiue, but more aboundant: the which is moſt certain and true. For ſeeing breath and bloud are of neceſſitie more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant in children, it cannot otherwiſe be, but that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall colour ought more aboundantly to poſſeſſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> putteth downe next hereunto a ſecond maner of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance to righteouſneſſe, as a poſitiue lawe to be obſerued of all men: the which righteouſneſſe conſiſteth to pay euery man his right, as well in due deſerts, as to him that receiueth it, as in diſcouering the glorious workes of naturall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> duetie in the payer: for herein not onely conſiſteth a ſimple temperance, for that it is a principall thing, agreeable with equitie, but alſo becauſe it is begotten and brought foorth, as a fructifieng tree, from natures perfect inclination. Wherefore wee are to thinke of, and inquire, whether nature hath fauoured one place,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5375:32"/> and countrey more then an other, in the fauourable behalfe of temperaunce, not onely for dutie in righteouſneſſe, but for the perfourmance of all honeſt actions. In perfourming which purpoſe, Greece is magnified and highly regarded as a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate countrie, both becauſe famous and excellent wits haue ſprong vp therein, as that experience hath tried them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people in ordinance of manners, and the workes of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome haue diſcouered them by their wholſome lawes both for martiall, polliticke, and ciuil gouernment, And the inclination of nature hath poliſhed them to walk moſt temperately in their conditions, during the courſe of this life.</p>

                  <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> in his orations againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, perſwadeth them to liue according to the temperate ſoyle of their countrie. And yet if we behold all liuing men in their order, there is not one ſo to be found, which attaineth that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of wiſedome and vnderſtanding, as hee ought to the vttermoſt of natures indowmentes, except ſome few perſons preſigned thereunto. And yet euery liuing creature redily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmeth ſome temperate worke of nature: as ſome men in running ſwiftly, ſome men in reſiſting ſtronglie, and ſome men in agilitie, and ſome men in policie, but fewe men in learning, wiſedome, grauity, and the naturall facultie of eloquent ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and the feweſt of all in the confeſſion of their creation: And yet euery one hath a ſeuerall worke of perfect temperance in the beſt behalfe.</p>

So that <hi>Lyonicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> hereunder, placeth Phyſiognomy to bee conioyned and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnder naturall forme, and therewithal the partes and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the body are framed, accordyng to the manners of the minde. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in like ſort dooth reckon the actions of the body, to be agreeable with moſt men, after the manners of the mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fuchſyus</hi> ſaith, a temperate body is not conſidered or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in the waight of the elements, but in the perfect action of euery ſeueral me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. If which reaſon be true, then thoſe bodies cannot be temperate, which are not faſhionable: then alſo thoſe actions which are done without forme, are neyther perfect nor effectual. No credite is aſſumed hereunto, eyther of learning, wiſedome, or experience: for otherwiſe the head cannot conceiue any good purpoſe, if the ioyntes be peruerted from nature.</p>
               <p>Surely the higheſt and happieſt temperance appertaining hereunto, is when the mind in naturall propertie is prouided to all good deedes and perfect workes, and that nothing may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or entercept the honeſt intent thereof, this is perfect tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.

                  <hi>Vliſses</hi> may be adioyned an example hereunto, who was far wyſer then <hi>Achilles,</hi> notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he wanted outward indu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments &amp; comely forme, which both <hi>Achylles</hi> &amp; <hi>Nereus</hi> poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. I wil poſſith foorth a liuely picture in the perfect diſcription of this matter, of one <hi>Acſop</hi> a Philoſopher, of all men that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in his age, was in all the partes of his body moſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as being goor-bellied, bowe-legged, crooked-backed, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapen head, with a crooked necke, the carootes thereof were both, ſhort and ſlender, hauing alſo flat noſtrels, and hanging lips ouerreaching their ſights in all miſhapen deformities: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, nature indued him with a temperate brame, hee was moſt wittie, pregnant, fruitfull, and in ſetting foorth of fayned fantaſies and ſodaine deuiſes among al men then liuing moſt happy. Therefore it followeth, that the beſt faſhion in body doth not attaine the beſt and wholſommeſt temperance, in the ornament of the mind. <hi>Manardus</hi> is deceiued, affyrning that outward forme is better then inward temperance: which if it ſhould ſo fall out, forme is the principall and efficient cauſe, and inward temperance is a cauſe coniunctiue following. For <hi>Aiax</hi> was of a faſhionable, ſtrong, and mighty body: yet was he mad, raging and furious: ſo that it is to be prooued, that the outward frame and forme (although it be neuer ſo faire and beautifull) cannot be well directed and gouerned, where inward tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wanteth. And <hi>Hypocrates</hi> affyrmeth that forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, with reaſonable creatures, ought to be poſſeſſed vnder a proportion or meaſure of the inward qualities, and that tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a ſeaſonable gift, from that heauenly workman, infuſed

               <p>And <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that the deuine cauſe hath faſhioned the proportion of the body, after the maners of the minde, and doe many times oen of them agree with an other, which if it doe ſo fall out, then corporall actions and naturall conditions, depend within themſelues, one vpon another, by a mutuall conſent in temperance.</p>

And yet as a melancholicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vnder his temperance, may be indewed with a ſtrong and ſtiffe memorie, yet by the ſame propertie hee ſhall nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle eyther in imagination or conceit: ſo alſo ſome others may be inſigned to preuayle in other good ornamentes, as abilitie of learning, or ſharpeneſſe of wit and vnderſtanding, except me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie which is not placed a like in all men: for no man is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie on euerie behalfe.</p>
               <p>Surely ſenſible creatures (as <hi>Auycen</hi> affirmeth) on the greateſt behalfe, doe followe the temperature of bloud, and that he alone is temperate, which is ſo meaſurable in all primarie powers, chiefly to ſatiſfie all naturall workes, which ought of dutie to be performed.</p>
               <p>For the more plainer vnderſtanding the deepe reach hereof, there is to be conſidered foure ſpeciall and naturall operations: atraction, retention, concoction, and expulſion. Theſe are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in double vſe for the ſeruice of the whole body, not onely touching the inward parts, properly belonging to the ſtomacke and liuer, but there are ſome outwardly deputated, for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual vſe to miniſter inward reliefe and nouriſhment, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the whole bodie: ſo that he which is perfect in euery worke hereof, is highly preferred in temperance.</p>
               <p>Theſe thinges are manifeſtly inough diſcouered, and their difference onely conſiſteth herein, for that euery one ſerueth hys place to ſome proper worke. And yet theſe inward workes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelues to euerie one that outwardly, and ſeriouſly beholdeth them: as boldneſſe, feare and ſuch like. Therefore a temperate man is neyther bold, nor feareful, but ſtrong: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther headlong, nor ſlowe, but ſpeedie: neither cruell nor ſoft, but gentle: neither enuious, nor yet a negligent deſpiſer of other mens ſubſtance, but a louer of his owne eſtate: no tyrant, nor raſhly mercifull, but righteous: neither full of hatred, nor loue, but a louer of his friends. Theſe affections are poſſeſſed vnder the liuer and lightes, in which place loue and deſire haue their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5375:36"/> chiefe and principall manſion: And therfore this prouerbe hath bene vniuerſall among philoſophers, that the liuer is the cauſe of loue, and the ſpleane moueth laughter, although oftentimes ſadneſſe draweth occaſion from the ſpleane thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> in his third booke of affections, the fourth chapter, calleth theſe affections morall workes, and vnreaſonable, for that they proceede from an vnreaſonable ſoule. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth that ſo long as the ſoule and the mind conflict within them ſelues, theſe differences are made: that the minde is increaſed with morall paſſions, and the ſoule with principall faculties.</p>
               <p>The ſoule is a created ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, inuiſible, hath no image nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion but onely of his creature: The minde after the opinion of the philoſophers, poſſeſſeth the heart, foraſmuch as from that place proceedeth boldneſſe, valiantneſſe, and ſtoutneſſe, feareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and cowardly daſtardneſſe.</p>
               <p>There is no man that denieth, or may interdict the minde from participating with the heart: Therefore the minde and the heart mutually inhabite one with another, and ſometimes the ſoule conſenteth with all the paſſions of the minde, and paſſe ouer in mutuall agreement alike: hereby the ſoule is ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the minde, that the ſupreame dignitie thereof, falleth downe into the morall partes.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> ſayth, that when the ſoule and the minde are vnited and compaſſed within the morall paſſions, ſadneſſe, feare, boldneſſe and ſuch like belongeth thereunto: all which doe ſeaſon the perfect nature of a temperate man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieremie Thriuerius</hi> ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> although the minde is poſſeſt with reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding vnder the power of the ſoule, yet if conceit eyther decayeth, or ſwarueth aſide, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right vſe of the principall faculties, the wit is vanquiſhed, and the minde wandreth at large, hauing neyther guide nor place: heereupon falleth out the diſeaſe of madneſſe. Yet if the wits and the mind ſometimes appeale to the primarie ſences, and vncertainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire againe, then the diſeaſe is lunaticalli following the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or diſtemperance of the moone and the elementes. And alſo when the wit is apprehended by ſecret motions, and by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine alienations carried a farre off, the diſeaſe is then called

                  <hi>Galen</hi> conioineth vnto this temperature, a naturall, actiue, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platiue motion: and ſaith, that a man which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of foure elementes ought to be indifferent in all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, aſwell in collour, ſtature and ſmoothneſſe, as courage, ſtoutneſſe, and all other conditions belonging to mercifull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in a bleſſed mind.</p>
               <p>Hereunto alſo is commended vnto vs, an excellent temperance in the hayre of the body, which is beſt agreeable to yoong men, natiuely brought vp in temperate regions: It largely ſheweth the powerful and luſtie gouernment of youth, adorning yoong yeares aſwell in nature, as in complexion: For all other ages are intemperate. Wherefore in reckoning vp the drift of ages by dyuiding and directing the life of man into diuers and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able courſes, from his firſt age to his laſt and finall end, we are firſt to conſider of infancie, which hath continuance from the firſt natiuitie, to the ſpringing of the teeth: Then childehoode afterwardes taketh place vntill yoongmanſhip, called adoleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie (which is the ripeneſſe of time to generation, to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed) which age is commonly knowen by hayres, eyther a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the chin, or priuie partes: this age is very hot and moyſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, this age beginneth in virgins at twelue or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, and continueth to twentie and ſomewhat beyond: And in this age drineſſe hath his beſt place and chiefeſt felicity although heat and moyſtneſſe in moſt part of them, continueth

               <p>This commonly is well perceiued and knowen to fall out in ſouth countries, where heat and moyſture exceſſiuely ouermat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with many corruptions and diſeaſes, in ſuch raſh ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Galienſis</hi> ſaith, that although the ſouth countries bring foorth ſtrong men, yet their age is not certainlie of hotte and moyſt temperance, nor yet conſtant vnder drineſſe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt of all bendeth to extreame heat, which moiſtneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much inflamed therewith, as that the yoong and tender ſkinne is vtterly vnable to containe the meaſure thereof, but naturally ſpeweth and breaketh foorth without artificiall expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Next followeth mans eſtate, which ſtandeth for a while at a ſtay. And although their bodies by little and litle decaieth, yet their ſences continue vnbroken aboue fourtie yeares: and in ſome men of ſtong and ſound complexion vntill threeſcore and aboue.</p>
               <p>Then commeth olde age, alienating and declining aſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repleniſhed with melancholious coldneſſe and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, at which ſeaſon, blood and heat are ſetled and commixed in the bottome of the arteries, and vaines like dregges: And the longer they are ſtayed and lodged, ſomuch the ſooner the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rtion of blood is obſtructed and combuſted, and the ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and diſabled: the which falleth out, aſwell becauſe of thickneſſe in the ſhinne, growen and faſtened with the bones and ſinewes, as alſo becauſe the excrementes haue bene there long ſtaied and cloſed vp: The which calamitie many men in their decrepit, and extreame age, vndertake and ſuſtaine.

               <p>Therefore happy is luſty olde age, whoſe former puritie hath drawen comfort, eaſe and ioy vpon gray haires, whoſe bloud is odiferous and ſweet, whoſe breath is eaſie and who ſom, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are many which haue wandred very wide, both in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5375:38"/> conſtitution of old men and children, eſpecially <hi>Manardus</hi> firſt declaring that olde men be inforced with fleame, by reaſon of riotous youth and euerie variable accidence exhauſteth their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, with moſte perrillous peſtilences. This is contrary to <hi>Galen,</hi> who plainely affirmeth, that after olde age draweth on, the body is ſet free from all accidence, and bringeth forth diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of naturall propertie, for that nature eyther alienateth, or then weakeneth, or els quite decayeth.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, whereas <hi>Manardus</hi> ſeemeth to conioyne coldneſſe, as a naturall eſſence in children, his reaſon is proper, onely for that they tooke the ſubſtance thereof in the firſt place of generation, and their heate is afterwardes gathered rather by nouriſhable meates then of naturall ſubſtance. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to <hi>Galen,</hi> who is fortified with experience on the one ſide, and ſtandeth highly vpon the works of nature, on the other ſide, doth thinke that children are more hote and moyſt then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleſcency.<note place="margin">Children are apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe bloud.</note> And why is <hi>Galen</hi> moued ſo to thinke? Firſt, for that children hath multitude of bloud. Secondly, they haue gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe in appetite. And laſtly, they haue a ſubſtantiall valour in concoction.</p>
               <p>As theſe reaſons ſhewe a great ground why there ſhould be more aboundant heate in children, ſo he denieth their heate to be intentiue. For <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> verily affirmeth, that adoleſcencie hath more aboundance thereof, not according to the proportion of the body: For the body of a child, although in the ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie thereof hath not more intentiue heate, yet hath more coyious and intentiue bloud, then adoleſcencie. Surely children in their proportion obſerued and conſidered, haue a greedie and quicke deſire to ſuſtenance, and are of redie digeſtion therunto. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke it extreame madneſſe in <hi>Theophraſtus Peracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who abſolutely granteth a larger ſuſtenance to children, then adoleſcencie, ſeeing naturall operation refuſeth to be more ſtronger in children, and yet there heate is moſt plentifull, and their digeſtion moſt redie. Yet I doe not miſlike his difference made betweene children and infantes. For infantes in their firſt natiuitie, are colde, and therefore whollie giuen to ſleepe: but growing vp to children, are euery day more ſanguine, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5375:39"/> more hote and moyſt: for as heate prouoketh appetite, ſo moyſtaeſſe, is the cauſe efficient, aſwell to nouriſh great ſleepe in the body, as to aduaunce therewith the office of good nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment.</p>
               <p>And truely <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> affirmeth, that children are vnder diuers inclinements, both of weakeneſſe and ſtrength: And the ſame is well diſcerned vnder a double operation of their excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, as that the one being ouerſoft, and the other vtterlie voyd of moyſtneſſe. The firſt argueth moyſt coldneſſe, which ſtirreth vp a naturall deſire and diſpoſition to ſleepe in children, the other prouoketh and increaſeth bloud, releeueth and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the vitall partes.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher is woonted to declare, that moyſtneſſe is the firſt cauſe of ſleepe, and coldneſſe is the ſecond cauſe: And therefore when the humours of the body be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And except the ſame be preuented, oftentimes in glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous und glaſſie corruption, exceſſiuely draweth the body to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming diſeaſes therby: In this reſpect adoleſcencie ſurpaſſeth children in heate, or els not.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderſtanding hereof, let vs vſe this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon following, and agreeable hereunto: that if two cuppes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vnlike qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie, filled with hot pure water, without ſlime or corruption put thereunto, the qualitie of the leſſer, may exceed the quantitie of the greater in heat: and yet their equall quantity according to proportion is nothing diminiſhed. Euen ſo blood
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:5375:39"/> may according to proportion be matched in children and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcencie alike, &amp; yet their heate may exceed one aboue another.</p>
               <p>This is onely ſpoken, for that heate is eſtabliſhed by bloud: for as in ſome diſpoſitions, nature is earthly and colde from their conception, ſo heate of bloud aduaunceth and promoteth the ſame, to become vegetable and wholeſome in the vniuerſall partes of the body by nutrimentall meanes. For which reſpect if the qualitie be vnlike, yet the quantitie according to prporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may equally agree together. This proueth, heat in children and young men ought to haue ſeuerall proportions in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and yet in qualitie they doe exceede vnlike: for as heate in yoong menne may be more ſharper, ſo in children more ſweeter and taſtefull. And whereas bloud is in Children more intentiue, ſo heat is in yong men more intentiue, as is aforeſaid. For which cauſe, medicines prepared for yoong men, are of more higher degree, both in nature and operation, Otherwiſe vnforceable to reach the conſtitution of adoleſcencie, onely and becauſe of their high courage and ſtrength, which is in the ſubſtance of thetr intentiue heate: for which cauſe, the greateſt ſkill that belongeth to the heedefull and wiſe phiſitian is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, to conſider aſwell of the cauſe as the conſtitution, that temperance may thereby be perfected into good eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by qualitie, and that medicine and the body doe not exceede one another. For heate ought to be more ſharper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended therein, not by a variable ſubſtance in it ſelfe, but by artificiall helpe aduaunced thereunto, ſo that ſometimes bodies of cold and raw conſtitutions doe ſwiftly haſten towardes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous diſeaſes, except onely tranſlated into ſome other more perfect nature, or otherwiſe reuiued both in ſubſtance of bloud, and ſtrength of heate. As if a hote ſtone being dipped in a cold bath, or a colde ſtone in a hote bath of water, doth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alter both the water and the ayre, to be of a like qualitie with the ſtone. So theſe diſtempered bodies are reformed by artfull knowledge to become in equall temperance alike: and yet not in operation, for want of bloud, ſo that heate may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, or the exceſſe thereof diminiſhed. For like as difference is interpoſed betweene a cleere and groſſe ayre, as hauing like

               <p>There is a difference to be ſet downe in the outward eſtate of two temperat bodies together.

For if the heate of adoleſcencie and childhood, may be found equall by teeling, then would it fall out, that the compariſon of ages betweene adoleſcencie and children, were of neceſſitie equall: vnto which there muſt be adioyned both diſcretion, conſideration and conſtant ſtay. For <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith, that yong men which are perfect in conceit &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, are of hote diſpoſitions, &amp; haue verie little deſire to ſleepe, the which thing ſomewhat bendeth towardes drineſſe:<note place="margin">Hote braines are apt and inuentiue and ſmall deſire to ſleepe.</note> And yet nothing is in the obſcure workes of nature to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned in them either by feeling or touching.</p>

For where the ſubſtance falleth away, there putrifaction beginneth a common calamity, nature vtterly deſiſteth, and leaueth of her common and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue courſe thereby.</p>
               <p>Theſe differences of moyſtneſſe and drineſſe (by alteration of nature) are knowen in ſuſtance of all liuing things. For wher liquid propertie of fluxing hath power, there the courſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption poyſoneth and putrifieth all thinges: for fluxible things are moiſt, ouerflowe and run foorth, abroad to euery detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal miſchiefe, and thoſe thinges which eaſilie concreat are ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie drie, and will not afterwardes vnderbend to the qualitie of moiſtneſſe. So after this manner the contrarieties of drineſſe and moyſtneſſe, are in their natures eſteemed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted off. We are then to conſider not onelie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which euery man is beſt diſpoſed vnto, but all the partes of a man, vnder what conſtitution, eyther of drineſſe or moyſtneſſe he doo wholly depend. As firſt, wee are to pleade vpon the highneſſe and excellencie of fatneſſe, which is ſo much aduanced in the bodie of man, As that thorow that mediocritie all voluptuous delightes are proſpered, and by the exeſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the vitall blood is much corrupted: And as pure fatneſſe is contayned vnder health and wholſomneſſe, ſo fat which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of gluttonous ingurgitation is verie deceitfull to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And therfore fatneſſe is contayned vnder diuers kindes, and after diuers complexons, ſo the propertie thereof is alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. For as faines inlarded vpon the fleſh, is moſt purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into ſubſtance, ſo is it moiſtly nouriſhable in digeſtion. And yet the parchment ſkin called the membrans, as the calle<note place="margin">This moiſtnes is like a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gutter which if the fountaine be ſtopped aboue the gutter forthwith dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beneath.</note> and fylme, wherin the guters or bowels are lapped, are moſt drie after the opinion of <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> both becauſe their moiſtneſſe ſwiftly is tranſported into the liuer vaines, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes deuoided away by the vrine, or ordour, and alſo for that all the inward partes continuallie, as alſo hotly and exceſſiuely breathing thereupon made thereby of neceſſitie drie: although hot moiſtnes reeketh thereupon, yet can it neuer growe into

               <p>There is an other fatneſſe impertinent from the temperature of man, called tallow, onely belonging to Oxen and other ſuch like vnreaſonable creatures, partible in the hooffe, the which is both drie and yearthly.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there is an other fatneſſe called greaſe, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appertaineth to man, except that which moyſtlie is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the gall. And as that greaſe which is ſo gathered is moyſt, ſo is it moiſtlie digeſted, and drawen into moiſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, eſpeciallie vpon claw footed beaſtes and foules of the ayre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> aſſureth, that nothing is more preſeruing to mans life then naturall greaſe, gathered vpon pure and perfect ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet many make no choiſe of their meates, but in their fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doo groſlie ſatiſfie appetite, greedilie furniſh their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maches, and in purſuing their owne delightes, doo thereby vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie diſfauour complexion, corrupt blood, and nouriſh diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And the fatneſſe ſo gathered vppon ſuch ſlymie and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſuſtenance, is moyſte in the higheſt degree: thorowe which the bodie is ingroſſed, the guttes puffed, the braines inuapoured, and the ſtomach ingurged, Beſides which, it dooth congeale into a variable viſcous, and matery ſubſtance of waterie blood, inundating between the ſkinne and the fleſh: ſo that ſwelling tympanies oftentimes breake foorth in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome generation thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſayth, the ſpirite, the heart, the bloud, the liuer, the ſingle fleſh, the muſculous fleſhe, the ſpleane, the raynes, the arteries, the vaines, are hote by accidentall meanes, otherwiſe they are cold: this his meaning is left raw and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſoned: it is to be coniectured he meaneth thoſe accidentes to be the nouriſhment which increaſeth, proſpereth and cheriſheth thoſe parts of the body, in qualitie and quantitie, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after the maner of the membrance, woulde debilitate and ſurceaſe their power. All this conſidered, as the ſpirite is more exquiſite and ſearching ſo is it alſo in due propertie more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer then bloud. Likewiſe and on the contrary, the arteries with the vaynes and fatneſſe, are hote, and yet by all and euery euill and ſubtill accidents, colde, if the body infecting or touching be found ſoft, it is not forthwith moyſt: for reaſon may not iudge ſuch a bodie to be ſoft, which by vnnaturall humour is manie times fluxible. For euen as wax is not of his owne propertie onely moyſt, as by the exceſſe of accidentall heate put thereunto, ſo cleere water, is thickned or hardened by accidentall colde.

                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> doth affirme, that a thinne body ſheweth frugall fatneſſe, nouriſhed in the warmeneſſe of a thinne bloud. So theſe groſſe bodies nurſe vp thicke bloud, and venomed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</p>
               <p>Theſe men are in a moſt dangerous caſe, if there be a colde congealement in the vaines and other members, which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſurfetting dronkardes and ſuch like diſordered perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth, verie muche good appertaineth to thoſe men, which are perfected vnder a meaſurable comprehenſion. Firſt if their bloud be hote, thinne, and clearely recourſeth in the vaynes: if their breath be ſharpe, ſweete and thinne: if their bloud be warme, ſharpe and ſweete, all which maketh indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a perfect ſubſtance, except theſe natures be poyſoned otherwiſe by ſome cold vaporous accidentes: for colde things doe eaſily concreate vppon a warme ſubſtance: or except alſo this vnnaturall, diſtemperat coldneſſe, falleth out in melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious complexions, whoſe bloud is thicke, ſlimie, and ſower. And yet there are ſome ſanguine complexions of inclineable fat, as they doe greatly fauour daintie meates, ſo doe they yeld good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5375:44"/> liking to euery ſeuerall office and portion in the body. And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euermore fauoureth, comforteth, nouriſheth and purgeth theſe complexions in her owne propertie.</p>
               <p>Theſe complexions doe neuer concord with anie earthlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, but ſpeedily decay and periſh therewith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth in his booke of ſimples, that the naturall fat in theſe men is both hote and taſtfull: And the waterie fat, which is congeſted into ſubſtance vpon theſe men is ſower, bitter, and expoſed to innumerable perils. Alſo when thinne portions of this earthly bloud, thorow cold vapours is made thicke, and thorow ſlender vaynes falling downe, beſt liketh and deſireth to poſſeſſe the coldeſt partes of the body, forthwith congealeth into cold fatneſſe, not onely thereby pearceth the thinne ſubſtance of the body, but alſo hurteth the naturall actions in the ſenſes, eſpecially by the diſeaſes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crampe, ſtitches, feauers, rewnis, crickes, lameneſſe, numneſſe, painefull gripinges and ſuch like: whereas otherwiſe, good nouriſhment, warmeneſſe, comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweates, bathinges, opening the poores, electuaries, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginges, omiſſion of bloud, choyſe of meates, might be ſufficient meanes, to chaſe away the intollerable hurtes and perilles that may inſue heereof, as alſo by preſeruing and nouriſhing of a more hotter and ſweeter bloud.</p>
               <p>Next followeth that whatſoeuer hath bin ſpoken heretofore, touching drineſſe in the oment of the belly, which is a couerture aboue and beyond the filme, vnder which all the guttes are lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, ſo there is another oment in the head which is moyſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſkinne or rim of the brayne and commonly called of the chyrurgians <hi>pia mater:</hi> It is coarcted in the middle partes of the head, with many offices and appurtenances thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore aſwell ſuch men as women, whoſe bodyes are inueſted with corpulent and fattie fleſh, are moleſted in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof with an interflowing inundation, ſo that their complexion is commonly moyſt and there oment in the head moyſter.</p>
               <p>Yet ſurely there are ſome natures, ſo equally compacted in the order of the foure elementes, whoſe temperance is vnder the gretlie word <hi>EVCRATON,</hi> which is neuer changed or
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5375:44"/> moleſted with any malignitie, but ſtand mightilie againſt all diſtemperances. And as their temperatures are indifferent in all meaſures, ſo are they neuer deprehended by any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie or euill accidence: if the bloud be thicke, then the vaines be ſtraight and narrowe, and the blood ſlowlie interfloweth.</p>
               <p>The which ſort of men are troubled with giddines and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the head, are vnable to indure any paines, or vndertake faſting or honger: Whereas the other temperatures vnder this word <hi>EVCRATON</hi> vndertake ſtrongly, are ſwift in digeſtion, do wholſomly nouriſh al ſuſtenance: into perfect ſubſtance their blood floweth and comfortablie interfloweth in the courſe of the whole bodie: Their ſleep is ſweete, chearable and reſtfull: they liue in health: Their yoong daies are ioyfull, and their old daies peaceable to their graue.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing we are farther to purſue the bodie of man in hys whole and ſubſtantiall eſſence, wee are next to conſider the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures of the ayre. And although <hi>Auycen</hi> reporteth, that the bones of man hath more drineſſe then the hayres, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not otherwiſe reade, but that hayres haue encreaſe of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vapour, and the bones are vnder a ſharpe thinne vegetation of blood: and the ſtronger nature is, there the increaſe is made more valourable, thicke and ſtyffe: and as nature is inſigned out in the worke hereof moſt perfect to the eies of all men, ſo doo they valiantly ſuſtaine the trauels and miſeries, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to this life.</p>
               <p>Here might be a gathered coniunction in the temperatures of the griſtles or the griſtely lygumens, the tendons, which are the great ſinewes, or the cordes of the body: as alſo the arterick vaines, where the ſpirit of life recourſeth, and the hard and ſoft ſinewes ſenſitiue, with the ſpinall marrowe. For the more ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe portions doo appeare, the rather doo they obtaine and generate an indifferent nature, both of moiſtneſſe and drineſſe, aſwell of heat, as of colde: ſo that the good temperature of all theſe portions in the body, doo yeeld a perfect increaſe and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the hayr of the head, except they be diſtempered tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>row any ſuperfluous accidence otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Raſis</hi> ſayth, that the haire is a materiall cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5375:45"/> from the humours of the inward partes of the body, as of the vaines. <hi>Ruellius</hi> ſaith, that ſtrong is the officient and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect cauſe of thicke haire, which ſomewat conſiſteth and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ayeth vnder the eſtate and condition of the ſkinne, and is not genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of euery ſuperſiuitie, ercept onely of that ſuperaboundant temperature, which is gathered in the extreame partes of man: and thoſe excrements are variable. As firſt, the excrementes in the bleather are of two ſortes: the one cleare, and the other thick: the one is called Hypoſtaſis, which by a perfect digeſtion<note place="margin">The excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture is of two ſortes.</note> is aduanced in the ſubſtance of the brine, and either is in the blather or ſeroot, or ſtrained and extenuated from the bodie, is paſſed ouer into vapours, for the increaſe of hayres: or els in ſtyrring and chafing the body, is deliuered foorth by ſweates, or els groweth into flegmatike inundations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> auoucheth that there is one part thereof aſcending vp and peacing the braines, deliuered and abſumed away, by a dry rewmatike ſpyttell, an other part is deliuered away by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of excrementes at the noſtrels, and an other part is deliuered away by ſwea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For although humours doo ſometimes abide within thoſe thin breathinges, yet haue they no due ordinance from nature: and therefore for that nature hath no power nor force in thoſe degenerate humours, doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire backe, and in reſpect of exceſſe moyſtneſſe, cannot continue themſelues within their poores, or breathing places, vntil there be a ſufficient generation gathered together, ariſing vp into a fulneſſe of hayres, in the head, beard, or priuie partes, in which<note place="margin">Nature wolde not diſornate the beautie of the face with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> places the humours doo longeſt abide and ſettle. And nature hath prepared a way and paſſage for thoſe excrementes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe by the banke and brinkes of the cheekes, to the chinne, whereby there ſhould be a comely grace in the haires, vpon the fauaur of the face.</p>
               <p>There remaineth a probable coniecture for vs to thinke, that haires doe onely increaſe of excrementes thicklie congeſted: and the rather are we ſo to thinke and iudge herein, for that ſome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5375:45"/> part of thoſe excrements ſenſiblie paſſe away by weakneſſe, as alſo for that they are vniuerſal throughout the body. For when the body is diſturbed, by any fuliginous or ſmokie vapours, then the outward forme of the bodie altereth and changeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: beſides which, the haires doo eyther alter in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme, and fall away, as leaues decay from the moyſture of the tree.</p>
               <p>And ſurely it is a high Philoſophie to conſider, that when the body is looſe and purgatiue of nature, ſuch excrementes foorthwith doo yeelde and deuoyd, that the poores therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all open, waxe weake and looſe, ſo that many times thoſe open exhalations doo not onelie diſturbe the bodie, but as ingroſers of pure bloude, diſcouer themſelues, yet in ſtay of their malice become ſubiect both to naturall and artificiall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Therefore <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> ſaith, that excrementall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are no cauſe of growth in the hayre, but good blood: and that as blood flouriſheth and decayeth, ſo hayres both in youth and age, diſcouer and open themſelues: and alſo for that ſickneſſe extenuateth blood, dooth alſo decay haires in the bodie, being extenuated from blood. Alſo as health increaſeth blood and good liking in the body, ſo the haires therewithall proſper, flouriſh and growe foorth at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> diſcourſeth and trauelleth moſt highlie heerein, that blood is no cauſe of hayre, but rather a vaporous exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from blood: And as blood changeth, ſo exhalations doo herein alter: ſo that <hi>Avycen</hi> agreeth not with <hi>Dyoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides.</hi> Yet <hi>Galen</hi> flatlie concludeth, that moiſtneſſe is the cauſe of hayres: and although the bodie bee ſtrooke aſunder from the head, yet there is an increaſe of hayres, ſo long as there is moyſtneſſe in the heade, and therefore deade men haue increaſe of hayres, vntill all moyſtneſſe be abſumed by putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Let vs alſo in this treatiſe ſomewhat diſcouer the growth of hayres, which after the ſtraightneſſe or crokenedneſſe of the poores be either curled or ſtraight.</p>
               <p>Theſe curled haires fall out of diuers cauſes: not becauſe the ſkinne is ſoft of it ſelfe, neyther becauſe the exhalation
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5375:46"/> is weake, but becauſe the paſſage of the exhalation is croſſe, and the poors crooked, otherwiſe haires are inlarged in a right courſe, aſwell by ſtrong vapours, by temperate moiſtnes, and ſoundnes of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> reproteth an other cauſe of curled haires: as both becauſe the rootes of the haires, are wrinkled in the right paſſage, thorow exceſſe drineſſe, as alſo becauſe exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are in their natures ouer drie, fuliginous and ſtretched: And (as <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith) for that, moyſtnes is deuoured and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp by a contrarie effect of drineſſe: Wherefore haires both in collour and curlednes, and playnneſſe do differ according to theſe courſes. And yet <hi>Raſis</hi> ſayth, all hayres follow their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural complexion in collour, vntil old age conuneth on, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all thinges,</p>
               <p>Let vs take better examples hereof, in the difference between the haires of a man, and a beaſt: for that the moyſteſt ſkin is allowed by naturall courſe, to haue the thickeſt and ſhorteſt haire, &amp; the rather for that hot moiſture floteth and ſwimmeth between the ſkin and the fleſh, is of like quality in all the parts, aſwel of clouen hofed, as claw-footed beaſts, ſo that the growth of haire in a beaſt, is like a flaſhie freſh medowe ouer floten with a ſhalow water in the rootes, and the graſſe therewithall ouer floriſheth: but cold froſtes and alteration of weather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth and periſheth the roots thereof. Euen ſo intemperate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of times and ſeaſons, ouerturneth the naturall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of haire, in all vnreaſunable creatures. So likewiſe in theſe humain complexions, whoſe hayre although it be of moſt high qualitie in plentifull growing, yet thorow exceſſe benerie falling into cold diſeaſes, their haire decayeth, waxeth thin, and vtterly looſeth in the roots, eſpecially when the poores in a mans body are ouer traueiled by a moyſt exhalation.</p>
               <p>Thophraſtus Paracelſus putteth foorth theſe reaſons, that footſteps in moiſt groundes, are eaſilie with euery ſtorme wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed away, but footſteps in drie groundes doo longeſt indure &amp; abide. So that, as theſe moiſt exhalations in the fleſh, do nouriſh and greatly comfort the haires, ſo alſo if thoſe exhalations bee altered, either by malign vapours, or corrupt blood, or diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5375:46"/> by the contagion of colde diſeaſes, the haires decline and vaniſh therewithall.</p>
               <p>Now furthermore there are ſome bodies, whoſe drineſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth on the contrary, and yet vnder ſome moyſture produce a competent number of hayres: but when their drineſſe becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth combuſt, are like to ſtarched earth, which without ſome moyſture cannot bring forth graſſe. This drineſſe vnder the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ages of men happeneth in the braines. So alſo there is another ſorte of men who are like vnto moyſt tempered clay in ſpring ſeaſon, or beginning of ſommer, yet partched vp and ouerdried in the latter end of the yeare, bring forth nothing but barrenneſſe and duſt. So there is a moſt vnhappie ſort of men, who by ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſe drineſſe in their adoleſcencie, become bald, bare and barrainous in their braines, towardes their latter age.</p>
               <p>It is to be marked that hayres in al ages, follow the courſe and temperance of nature, and leaue off to ſhew themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe properties, vnto whome they doe appertaine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſayth, that a bald-headed man, is deſtitute of moyſtneſſe in the braine pan, &amp; the rather becauſe the vaynes of the necke, beeing called the guides, are obſtructed, doe not perfectly recourſe, except vpon the hinder part of the head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieremias Thriuerius</hi> ſayth, that it is as vnpoſſible a thing, for lobſters or crab-fiſhes to beare feathers, or oyſters wooll, as a bald-headed man to produce naturall hayre: not onely becauſe there is both an opilation in bloud, but alſo becauſe there is an extreame drineſſe, and ſhrinking of the ſinewes, in thoſe mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall partes of the braine.</p>
               <p>Surely all drie complexions of black chollericke inclination, are hearie in the higheſt degree, but falling into contagion and hote diſeaſes thorowe the ſame, as they doe become bare and bald, ſo are they men of verie euill and dangerous maners. Yet <hi>Auycen</hi> greatly commendeth bald men, of ſanguine complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and flaxen hayre, to be truſtie, honeſt, and verie preciſe and deuout: and yet manie of them haue reaching wittes in high cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſayth there can be no direct temperance in bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for that in the firſt place, thoſe thinges which be hearie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5375:47"/> onely are hote and moyſt: In the ſecond place bald men are drie, and in the third place, bald men are in their extreames: ſo of ſickeneſſe and diſcaſes, doe ſwiftly approoue in the nature of cold and drie: therefore we are verely to coniecture, that all ages of men, denunciat their natures after the temperance of the regions and countries, vnder which they are borne, aſwell as their owne priuate complexion and age: for as the ages of youth are hote drie and hayrie, ſo infancie is ſmooth colde and moyſt and without hayre. Then ſeeing there muſt altogether fall out a perfect ſympathie, or equall combination vnder the temperatures of countries, and that hayrie men natiuely apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnder regions hote and drie: ſo then there muſt be a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat cauſe in contrarietie hereof, for that <hi>Theophraſtus Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> holdeth in opinion that hote and drie countries, abſinne and quite take away all the humours, which intentiuely nouriſh hayres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> ſayth, that heate and drineſſe in thoſe bodyes, are not ſo eaſily nouriſhed, and therefore heate and drineſſe of thoſe countries, are nothing profitable in the generation of hayres after the naturall ſimpathie, and mutuall combination in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of the bodies themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaketh of young men of the Ethiopians, who of their owne complexion and naturall inclination, are hote and drie, in reſpect of other countries, the which propertie furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth their bodies with an exceſſe ſtrength of hayres: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though curled, yet not diuerſty coloured like other countries, which ſignifieth the ſuperaboundant heate, vnder which they liue.</p>
               <p>Surely I am perſwaded, it is a moſte direct poynt, not to compare nature with age, but to compare countries with ages, which in all the conditions of hayres, may be beſt accompted of: For the Ethiopian yoong men in temperance of hayres, both in multitude and ſtrength, exceedes the yoong men of theſe our countries in the higheſt degree.</p>
               <p>Let ſomewhat more, in this our treatiſe, be attended vpon, and diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in the temperance of women, touching hayre, for that there are ſome who thinke the ſame farre diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5375:47"/> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our purpoſe: that is, a woman of cold &amp; moyſt te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, is indewed with a vecie thick hayre, who for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall ſubſtance of moyſtneſſe following vpon her, hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many hayres, but moſt long hayres, for which cauſe, women of moiſt complexions can neuer be bald. And a flegmatike wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man following the temperance of the whole body, cannot in any reſpect, want hayres, and ſometimes exceedes therein farre otherwiſe then common courſe, Except a woman of moderate and due temperance, which cannot ouer paſſe the boundes and limites of nature, in the ornature of the body: for thoſe women are of pure feminine complexion, and are not bearded like men for two cauſes: the one, becauſe the vapours of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, are ranckly deuoyded by naturall profitmitie, as alſo for that the aſcending moyſture thereof, is ſubtilly occupied in the braines, for the plentifull generation of haires, ſo that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hin partes are vtterly barrained thereby. Then touching thoſe hayres, which haue comely treaſes vpon the eye-lids, &amp; bankes of the browes, doe ſhewe the excellent ornature and ſeemely grace of nature, by a certaine liberall benefite, in beautifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng the womans proportion, tarre aboue all other creatures: for as theſe hayres are outwardly planted, ſo are they regarded as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, and ſpringing vp in their due diſpoſition, by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view, for if they did follow the temperature of men, they ſhould grow confuſedly and without order. Then how greatly doe thoſe women ſcandelize both nature and affection, which by colouring, criſping, platting or ſtriking forth of their haires, doe deforme and diſguiſe their fauour and countenance, in the open ſhame of the world: notwithſtanding all which, are not able to alter the ſeemely ſhewes of nature, whoſe power both in the head, banckes of the browes, and eye-lids, is both abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and artificially expreſſed. And I would haue it further knowne and marked, that the difference of moyſtneſſe and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in natures goodly works, is vnlike: as if graine or ſeedes were planted, or ſowed in earth of two natures, ſo that the one ſhould be in temperance more fruitfull then another, ſo doth the haire followe the temperance of the ſkinne, both in ſubſtance, complexion and colour. In like ſort, as the hayres in the heads
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:5375:48"/> of women, be moyſt or drie after their temperance, ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallie, both the hayres in the bankes of the browes and eye-lids are drie, becauſe the continuall humectation of the eyes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the ſame.</p>
               <p>But twiſe and once is either man or woman happie, who ſafegard their head vnder a drie temperance: for that moyſt corruptions within, do ſpeedilie and dangerouſly alter the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hayre, to become gray and griſly, and the rather, if the body be vnequally diſtempered, by any colde and vaporous diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore two ſortes of gray hayres are to be conſidered vpon herein. The firſt ſort, thorow the rage of ſurfetting youth, in the vntimely age of man, eſpecially when the temperance is altered by cold venerian vapours, the extreame malice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſuggeſteth theſe colde and perfect diſeaſes of feuers, bloudy eyes, flegmatike ſpittle, impoſtumations, ſhort breathinges, head aches, as alſo the whirling and giddineſſe of the braines. There are alſo gray hayres, which naturally fall vpon the pure olde age of man, ſignifyeng temperance, chaſtitie, ſoundneſſe of body, as pleaſure and health to the graue. As theſe graye hayres were attained and gotten by wiſdome and good aduiſe, ſo are they preſerued and continued, as an ornament of great and ineſtimable honour to olde age.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, after the temperance of hayre, the nayles of the hands and feete, are preſerued or decayed in good or euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion and eſtate: and yet they doe not ſo ſpeedily alter, by the interchange of the inward humours, as the hayre doth.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> ſaith, that a true martiall man is altogether without luſtfull pleaſure, or deſire towards women: and yet ful of mercie and loue towardes them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, that a ſhort necked man, is apt to conceiue, pregmaticall, and verie of dangerous diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet his body verie ſubiectiuelie is vanquiſhed, vnder euery ſtraunge accideniall diſeaſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that reaſon cannot inſtruct vs in theſe outward ſignes of nature, but an inward and direct conſtitution, maketh a perfect experience hereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> ſaith, that if the outward complexion be cold, the inward conſtitution is hot. If euill maners bee outwardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, the inward thoughtes are more eaſilie coniectured, which is more ſuffientlie prooued by the eſtate of ſeaſons and countries, for that all men generallie are procliue and apt to ſhew the maners of their countrie, in their conuerſation, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in pouertie or pride: either in rudeneſſe, or ciuilitie. We are therefore the rather to ſuſpect the wonderful and high conſtitutions of nature inwardlie, by theſe outward euill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and diſpoſitions: For in the ſouth regions all outward things are hot, and all inward thinges colde. So on the other behafe, all outward thinges vpon the north partes are cold and freeſing, when the inward eſtate is warme, and the temperance therewithall yeeldeth hot: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the people borne in thoſe partes of the world, are of moſt fierce courage: and although verie bolde, yet in all their enterpriſes headlong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auycen</hi> ſaith, thoſe which be borne vpon the Meridian point, are vnmeete for warres. So <hi>Iuſtin</hi> reporteth, that men of the north partes of the world, are in the beginning ſtout and fierce to battel, but their heartes in the end, are ſoluble and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the ſnowe. For all outwarde temperaunces doo retire and flie backe to the inwarde partes of man, by reaſon of outwarde colde: wherefore they haue not a ſtronge dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5375:49"/> but all inward thinges are in them thereby of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
               <p>Some may think that <hi>Hypocrates</hi> reaſoning with <hi>Galen,</hi> hath made a very vnlikely argument or proofte herein, as the Europians, are more fiercer then the Aſians, for that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure greater inequalities of ſeaſons: and whereas ſummer is verie hot in the one, and winter verie colde in the other, ſo an inward heat is contemperated vnder the condition or eſtate of either temperance. <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> verily thinketh, that <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> reſpecteth the experience which thoſe countries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue by by war, or by ſuch great inequalities of ſeaſons, are the better prepared to abide and ſuffer all interchangeable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of the bodie, which ought to be borne and ſuffered in warres, and therefore theſe ſortes of pleople are more fitter for wars then other countries.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certainlie to be credited that thoſe which inhabite the Meridian point, are more hotter in the liuer and hart, then other countries: yet their heat is ſtrange, not naturall: they haue plentie of good blood and breath: they are wiſe, but not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant: And thoſe which inhabite thoſe cold regions, are therefore flerce, ſtout and apt for warfare, and haue a conioined ſubſtance of breath and blood aboundantlie in their bodies. And therefore <hi>Auycen</hi> reporteth, that thoſe which inhabite vnder the Bear, doo in fiercenes, courage and valour giue place to no man. And <hi>Hypocrates</hi> doth call their temperance flerce and ſharpe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their heate is vnited and ouermatched with colde. Alſo in thoſe temperate regions which inhabite the Meridian point, heat draweth and inforceth heat, as may be well perceiued and vnderſtood in thoſe extreame and hot ſeaſons of the year, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſtrong and flerce corruptions, doo infect and draw vpon the bodie of man, by hotte and malicious contagions. So in theſe Europian countries, the times and ſeaſons of the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, exceſſiuely inforceth heate vppon the extreame partes of man: and alſo their winters are ouer much colde and very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the outwarde paries: ſo that their digeſtion in winter time is more ſtronge, and their naturall heate more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:5375:50"/>
               <p>There is a ſufficient diſcourſe in in the firſte booke of theſe<note place="margin">Chollerike men haue great tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in win<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter.</note> Temperamentes of chollericke men, inhabyting theſe Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian countries, whoſe outrage hath the greateſt domination in ſommer, and doo liue at moſt pleaſure, quietneſſe, and reſt in winter.

Yet <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſayth, that ſeeing nature hath differenced the chollerike man from the fiegmatike, by vnequalneſſe of ſeaſons, ſo the inwarde heat in the time of winter, is more ſhorter in the one, &amp; naturall heat in the time of winter is more ſtronger in the other, which if it be ſo, then all liuing creatures (without exception) are to haue a more pleaſant and happie eſtate of life in winter then ſommer, becauſe naturall heat is the artificer and inſtrument of all liuing thinges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> ſaith, that like as the ſunne is lodged vnder the darke vaines of the clouds, in the night ſeaſon, ſo heat is hidde and ſhrowded in the ſecrete vaines of all thinges in winter, and waxeth more outward and ſtronger with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the yeare, vntill by the temperature of the ſunne it bee powerfull and mightie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnoldus de noua villa</hi> affyrmeth, that the complexion of man ariſeth and falleth, with the temperature or diſtemperature of the yeare: ſo may we gather hereby that choller rageth and ſuper aboundeth more in ſommer then winter, only by an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue qualitie. Then fieam doth not argue no ful quantitie of heat in winter, but rather ſheweth ſome remiſſiueneſſe therein: for which we haue ſome opportunitie offered, to diſcouer theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures of the water, as the crab-fiſh, and other ſhel-fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, whoſe outward veſiure is alwaies hard and drie, yet there inward temperance is moyſt and ſoft, eſpeciallie in winter.</p>
               <p>The Phiſitians doe miniſter theſe and ſuche like fiſhes to patients, which are waſted and conſumed vppon the loonges and liuer, and other affected partes of the body, as a ſpeciall nouriſhment and reſtoratiue.

               <p>So alſo, a moſt high and ſingular commendation belongeth to the conſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gurnet.

               <p>And ſurely the ſtomacke indureth theſe vaporous humec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, rather by euill nouriſhmentes then anie diſtemperance of the bodie, or putrified corruptions in the ayre. And yet there are very great conſiderations to be herein vnderſtood: whether theſe belchinges, or coughinges proceede of euill nouriſhments, or of naturall humours in the body, or from accidentall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ayre. For if groſſe feeding and euill nouriſhments, be cauſe heereof, then the vniuerſall body is infected, with fuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous vapours, of diſpoſition, yeelding to be pituitous and flegmaticke: And if it proceede of naturall humours; and the body inclined thereunto, then the fleſhe abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And alſo if it proceede of the corruption and interchange of the ayre, the euidence thereof is regarded in the alteration and deflowring of the excrementes, by a pituitous diſpoſition of rewins in all partes of the body.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another moſte hote and contrary excrement, called choller: as it is deciued from the liuer, ſo doth it outrage, and ſuperabound in the bodies of thoſe men, ouer whom it bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth rule. If the ſtrength thereof grow great, and troubleſome it is beſt remedied by euacuation downeward, ſo that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours be before vnſetled, by ſome preparatiue medicine: But if the ſtomacke be therewith ouercharged, it were not amiſſe, by moyſt vomites, to be aduaunced vpward. And yet there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, which cannot be ſo helped: both for that they be naturallie diſframed, as alſo for that their paſſage from the gall to the bowels, is ouer-little, and more larger about the ſtomacke, comprehending exceſſiue excrementes, which impureth vitall bloud ouer groſly. For vnto whome ſuch choller is generated in the ſtomacke, cannot otherwiſe be withdrawne, except by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:5375:51"/> euacuation downeward: therefore it is both vnnaturall, and without arte, to purge them vpward, except there cannot be deuoydance otherwiſe, eſpecially and the rather becauſe of a greene rotten praſſiue ſubſtaunce congeſted in the ſtomacke. There is a further and a more higher waight to be heere in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, as not onely in putting a difference in knowing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers natures of this choller, but an artfull experience, in purging and putting away the ſame: For if it proceede from the liuer, it is yellow and pale: if it ingender vppon the ſtomack, it is greene, like to the colour of a Leeke: if it breede thorow a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious corruption, it is ouerpraſſiue, and an enemie to all the naturall and ſenſible members of the body, deflowreth, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loureth and defaceth mans natiue and perfect complexion, and in it ſelfe, fauoureth a venomous propertie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galens</hi> opinion is, that if a cold liuer be warmed vnder anie accidentall heate, it increaſeth and ingendreth a profluous chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, exceedeth all the heates of ſtomacke, and all other partes of the body, although they be neuer ſo full of feruour and heate. And greene choller hath for his condition and qualitie, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heate, which thorowe any accidentall diſlike, it be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the ſtomacke, doth forthwith recourſe to the liuer, and deſireth a perfection therein.</p>
               <p>Although appetite delighteth to gnawe and whet vpon groſe and fulſome meates, and to infarce and ingorge the ſtomacke therewith, ſo doe they contagiouſly breede, nouriſh and infeſter venomous choller to become high ſtubborne and vnuanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>So alſo there are ſome meates which in their owne proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, (thorow their exceeding corruption in the ſtomacke) doe eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porat and defume the braines, with greeuous ſwimming aches in the head, payneth &amp; aggrauateth the eyes. So hard egges, honie, ſhell-fiſh and ſuche like, as great and perillous inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of inforcing the danger hereof: And nature is alſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and painefully occupied in digeſting them, into a readie and perfect ſubſtance. As if it were ſowes fleſh, or buls fleſh, which impreſſeth and ſetleth rawe humours moſte deepely, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melt &amp; tranſſpread the whole body of man, ſo that no medicine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:5375:52"/> meanes, neither vpward nor downeward, maketh expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>
               <p>Surely the diſpoſition of the head, ought to be alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded vnder ſome temperance: as whether it be cold or moiſt, hote or drie: for coldneſſe bringeth foorth flegmatike humours, whoſe often and dayly diſtillations, abſumpt the good indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of the braine. For mordicat rewmes are hurtfull to all naturall operations, looſen the rootes of the hayres, diſcloſeth the body to all peſtiferous corruptions and ſtenches, dimmeth and obſcureth the eyes, dulleth the ſences, benummeth feeling, aſtonieth hearing, diſſmacheth taſting, and ſtencheth ſmelling: yet many groſſe contagious meates, are by wholſome ſauces qualified and delayed in the artfull knowledge, and ſkifull hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of good cookes. So alſo redolent wines, if they be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained<note place="margin">A good cooke is in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a good phiſitian.</note> into a perfect body, are both conuerted to fragrant bloud, and eſtabliſhe the complexion, to become delightſome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medious herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruellius</hi> affirmeth, that great operation conſiſteth in the vertue and propertie of a rawe or reare egge, eſpecially for the rewme, if it be wholeſomely taken: for then it purgeth foule bloud, ſtrengthneth nature, clenſeth the liuer, fortifieth the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, ſharpneth the ſences, melloweth and increaſeth appetite. And wine is much commended, if it be of good and perfect fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and ſubſtance, to be dronke therewith in the morning. All which being equally tempered doth much preuayle againſt fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke rewmes, for certainely theſe rewmes happen and fall out many times, by alterations and vncertainties of diets: Therefore it is to be diſtinguiſhed, whether it be an iſſue from the braines downeward, or a vapour from the ſtomacke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: And yet manie times alſo, the body is inclinatiue to theſe rewmes vnder ſtrange accidentes, by alterations and varietie of ſeaſons: then is it vnpoſſible to ouercome the incomprehenſible diſtemperances of nature.</p>
               <p>And laſtlie, there is a coniecture by ſome methood, to be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly diſcerned and regarded, not for inclinatiue diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onelie, but for ſundrie naturall infirmities and diſeaſes which moſt bodies vnder ſome elementall diſtemperan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Examples hereof may be taken from the primary reaſon, which is ioyned in propertie with fantaſie, and groweth in cuſtome both together to be bewrayed with Phiſiognomy, or outward geſture, whether it be in countenance or body. And as they are altogether vnited, and inſeperably magnified, to be of one perfect ſubſtance both in mind and maners, ſo euery man is thereby inwardly prooued or reprooued, in the whole vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall proportion of his ſaid bodie: ſo that as <hi>Raſis</hi> affyrmeth, that a flat noſed man, is of drie complexion, and a man hauing a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyſed noſe, indicateth much chollerike drineſſe. If he be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hollowe eies, ſignifieth drineſſe in the head: if he be of ſallow and pale countenance, ſignifieth moiſtneſſe: and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are in formes and faſhions contrarie to their diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And that howſoeuer nature hath portrayed with thin and hayrie legs, ſheweth a naturall drineſſe in the liuer, ſo red and fierie eies declareth the purity and ſmall quantitie of blood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Leonardus Fuchſyus</hi> ſaith, They which iudge vpon tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of many ages, offend very much. For doo not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes of haire, both by ſickneſſe and age, alter after the inward diſpoſition? And likewiſe, all members wrinkle and alter, after the inward corruption of naturall blood? Then the eaſieſt and perfecteſt iudgement that herein is to bee required vpon the ſeuerall temperatures of man is to coniecture vppon melancholike temperance, whoſe inclinement is colde and drie, and their blood ſooneſt dooth corrupt, which is beſt outwardly regarded by the outward alteration, and diſfaſhionment of hayres, which inwardly proceedeth of fuliginous blood and ſmokie humours: for the olde pouerbe is true, that ſoote is next ſmoke, and ſmoke next ſtre: &amp; wax after it is tempered, is more eaſile imprinted vpon with a ſcale. So likewiſe infections al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the humours, and humours alter the outward eſtate of man: and after that nature is made ſubiect to coruption, a ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion followeth euer after vntill death.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, there are many which cannot be recouered from this errour, affyrming, that temperature ought not to bee adiudged vpon in old men, eſpecially if they be flegmatik: for as old flegmatike men be cold an moiſt, ſo their excrements are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine and ſubiect to bloody fluxes, ſcowring laſkes, the vrine

I will not much herein trauell. For as one of them hath no powerfull, nor perfect conſtitution without the equall trauell and furtherance of one another.

And there muſt be hereunto alſo annexed not onely the ſenſible vnderſtanding of theſe naturall cauſes, but a iuſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſenting of their forcible power and vertue to haue one ſucceſſe. Alſo there muſt be a very high regard had, that medicines do nothing in nature digreſſe from the aſſenting inclination of ſuche bodyes, vnto which they owe their defence, helpe and ſuccour. For contrary medicines dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly doe imprint their malice &amp; power, inforcing the griefe to become more outragious inflammatiue and vnſetled: Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may inſtruct heerein, that a powerfull medicine in the fourth degree hote, cannot eſcape, or be driuen backe, from<note place="margin">Cauſticke i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For theſe putrifactiue or coroſiue playſters which in their cauſticke nature doe worke vpon out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſores, although they be ſodainly taken away from that place, ouer which they did worke power and effect, yet their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5375:55"/> impreſſion or action of heate, cannot ſodainly or vnawares be taken away, for the deepeneſſe of the ſore hath comprehended the power thereof. And therefore theſe inflammatiue actions, without more larger libertie and ſkill, cannot bee extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing by colde medicines is more clearely percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and vnderſtoode. For blacke popy cannot in the fourth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, vnawares be intertained into the body, but that, by the ſame meanes, doth oftentimes forthwith alter the body, and the actiue mouinges ſenſible hindered, in the vnnaturall courſe and action thereof.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe with hote medicines, which although they exceede from vs in common courſe of heat, yet the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many either be mitigated or vtterly put out.</p>
               <p>As touching cold medicines, the reaſon and vnderſtanding is not heereunto alike, becauſe coldneſſe, not onely deepely lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the vaines, but ſtoppeth the vegetation and quickeneſſe of nature, hauing once ouercome the ſenſible partes of man: that although warme thinges be proffered for reſtoring, quickning, and lifting vp of that ſleepie and deadly inuaſion, either ſhal it nothing at all preuaile, or els the ſenſible and naturall partes cannot be recouered to a perfect, and due eſtate and diſpoſition as before. For if colde water by a ſecret potentiall eſtate, be intertained into a warme body, and the body by a variable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition therof, altereth into a more higher degree of coldneſſe, doth extenuate nature, and decayeth the power of bloud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſtrength of the body exhauſteth the ſenſible coldneſſe thereof, yet there remaineth a ſharpe impreſſion for many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes to inſue.</p>
               <p>Furthermore warme water, being receiued into a hote bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, although it be poſſeſſed with the body for a whole dayes ſpace, as it hath nouriſhed vnder ſome naturall warmth by the ſtrength of the body, ſo can it not be otherwiſe knowne or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but that the body is made more colder thereby, although vnder naturall warmneſſe, it paſſeth from the bleather againe.</p>
               <p>So doe we beholde the power of a cataplaſma, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath a naturall power of coldneſſe, yet if it be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5375:55"/> and the place touched, all inflammations ſhall ſenſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more ſubdued, moderated and ſeaſoned, for inducement of a more higher and excellenter practiſe in the worke thereof, which as ſome holde in opinion is contrarie in powdred medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, whoſe power is onely to purge, drie, and excoriat. Yet no doubt there are ſome powdred medicines which in reuealing an imagination of drineſſe in ſubſtance, are in propertie altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moyſt. And except the body be of a drie chollericke diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ſhall nothing preuaile to accompliſhe any drie action to become perfect and ſound.</p>
               <p>Some will maruell, why the qualitie of elementes ſhoulde miniſter health, eaſe, and ſafegard to one, And ſhewe no poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall act, but rather offence, in another.</p>
               <p>Certainely as all inferiour cauſes are ſubiect to the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of celeſtiall diſpoſitions, ſo celeſtiall bodies are ſtable, firme, and perfect, and in their properties are voyd from alterations. Then no ſcruple herein neede to ariſe, whether this potentiall eſtate be ingendered or giuen to medicineable hearbs from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or from celeſtiall bodies.</p>
               <p>I doe thinke not onely power, but all indicible properties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy a metaphiſicall effect. And ſurely forme or bodily ſhape, which heerewith is adioyned, hath an indifferent participation from the complexion of elementes, and the condition of celeſtial thinges. Yet the iudgement of olde writers is, that the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theſe naturall cauſes, to be no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an indicible<note place="margin">All indicible thinges haue a indicible temperance.</note> temperature, hauing ſome indicible propertie: and forme is no other thing then a temperance in his owne nature, or the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and extraordinarie reaſon from the celeſtiall influence: therefore the naturall philoſophers haue not ſpoken in vaine, that <hi>Man and the ſonne did beget man:</hi> Then ſurely the ſtarres are nothing at all occupied in the generation of mixt things, rather doe they claime a moſt great part to themſelues of that which appertaineth to theſe immixt properties and powers: And it is no maruell, but that theſe vertues, powers and ſtrength, are ſo oppoſite and manifeſt to our feeling and perceiuing, that heate and colde ſhould alſo haue a ſingular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemmence in the ſtars. <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſayth that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5375:56"/> all theſe medicineable hearbes are not elementarily ingendred. But brought forth, of ſome deuine power, from the pure cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall eſtate aboue. But yet theſe elementall qualities ſo highly doe beare their force in the countenance of all inferiour thinges, and their powers are ſo full and large in all medicineable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes, that no furtherance or meanes preuayleth, eyther to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them, or els bring them backe, to any other ſtrange act, or vnuſuall alteration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> ſayth, that the deuine power moueth the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to become eyther naturall, or vnnaturall to the earth: And the earth withall the bountifull creatures therein, do take their eſſence, increaſe, or decreaſe from the due courſe or alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſaid elementes.</p>
               <p>The chiefe Philoſophers doe ſay, that the high fruitfull ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the ſunne, worketh vpon all liuing creatures, that all naturall cauſes greatly preuayle thereby.</p>
               <p>Then it is no maruell that ſingle medicines, haue an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat inclination in themſelues, but artificially qualified from their owne nature, haue a more clearer and peaceable effect: And although the ſunne, doth in euery place eaſt her ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power and ſtrength, yet not with one indifferent qualitie of warmeneſſe and heate, to be intertained into all thinges alike, not for that there is any defect in the primarie propertie of the ſunne, but becauſe there is a ſeuerall propertie from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of elements. For as no phiſitian can frame one medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, to be indifferently receiued and intertained into euerie ſeuerall conſtitution: So the ſunne is ſhewed forth in one force, and potentiall eſtate alike, although the action vpon all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cauſes vnlike for that, euery thing followeth the propertie of nature from the complexion of elements in generation and the propertie of the ſunne in augmentation.</p>
               <p>The vnſeaſonable elementes doe oftentimes darken the ſun, and thereby diſtemper and diſſeaſon the inferiour cauſes of the earth. So alſo the confuſed courſes and running together of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ourſing by an vnſingled and variable power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelues, is the onely cauſe why all the hearbes and fruits of the ſtelde, are of medicionable and ſaluing condition ouer
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5375:56"/> one, and nothing at all profiting but rather hurting vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Therefore the power of all theſe thinges are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed three maner of waies. As firſte, their poſſibilitie hath one ordinarie power in themſelues. Secondlie, that a ſupreame naturall ſubſtance, coagulateth in the power of all inferiour cauſes. Thirdlie, dooth in the ſame power obtaine and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh ſome effectuall propertie in it ſelfe, which by any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine accidents can neither be interuented, nor altered, except inforced from one propertte to an other, to ſome ſupreame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe within their owne naturall eſſence.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe medicines whoſe vertues are determined hot in the ſecond degree, are moſt eaſily made hot in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo moſt eaſily are they conuerted to fire in open extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, exceeding their natures: as vnflaken lune, roſenne, or gumme, which yſſueth from the exceſſe vapours of trees.</p>
               <p>But the greateſt danger happeneth in colde medicines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if nature hath determined their operation hotte, and their action colde: as the Hemlock, which of <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> is called <hi>Cicuta</hi> (a moſt poiſonſome practiſe in the fourth degree,) hath not onely a hot propertie and troubleſome effect, but an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue action of a colde benumming the ſences, which cannot bee afterwards raſed out. And yet many times ſome ſtrong &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible complections will rather alter and ſubdue ſuch ſtrong me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, to become inclinable to the body, then indure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be altered or ſubdued af the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, it is no perfect opinion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the olde nor new writers, that medicines ought to bee firſt drawen into actuall preheminence, before the corruption bee ſtyrred and prepared by ſome preparatiue or gentle mollefacei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the eaſier the power of of purgation is extended to mortifie and ſlay the diſeaſe: Alwaies prouided that medicines be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the nature of the bodie aſwel in ſickneſſe as in health. Like as clear water contemperated with pure wine, doth much profite, and ſeaſon a hot and inflammatiue bodie, to become ttmperate: After the ſame manner weake medicines, gentely are framed to doo their effect, then thoſe medicines which are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5375:57"/> of high and groſſe operation. For the more weaker medicines are compoſed, for ſlender bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the eaſier their ſtrength is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently knowne, their limits and bounds diſcouered, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leſſe feared. Whereas groſſe, hot and ſtrong medicines are ſubtill, fierce, eaſily doo inſinuate and winde themſelues into all the partes of man, and although they be moſt charily regarded, yet will they many times exceed art: wherefore medicine ought to be framed, and drawen after the meaſure of bodyly heate, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is no equall inſtrument of nature, neither can nature be vſed in her potentiall meaſure for the ſpeedy ouerthrowe of the diſeaſe. For as medicine ought to be framed moſt like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature, ſo the diſeaſe from time to time, is directed by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Therefore medicine ought to bee receiued into the body, vnder the warmneſſe of newe milke, or mans blood, although <hi>Galen</hi> counſelleth that medicines in ſommer ſeaſon bee proffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto ſome bodilie conſtitutions vnder the coldneſſe of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine water.</p>
               <p>But touching medicines outwardly applyed, ſome high and ſingular practiſe muſt be attained, for healing and curing ſuch outwarde ſores. Firſt, by rubbing and ſearching the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued place of the patient, whereupon ſometimes the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue infection of the furious and hot humour increaſeth, and far ſurpaſſeth the boundes both of medicine and nature, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, it be corrected by ſome drieng drinke, or purgatiue potion inwardlye taken: or that the outwarde medicine bee of ſome very colde and ſlender power in operation, which ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly is perceiued. For and if medicines be vnapt, they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarile wraſtle, both againſt nature and the afflicted ſore, as ſwiftlie, vncertainlie, and groſlie winde in their power and ſtrength. But if colde medicines be ſlowe, they may be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died and preferred (after the ſkill of the Chirurgian) to a more fuller and larger eſtate and degree.</p>
               <p>Yet hot ſearching and inflammatiue medicines, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie required in fulſome, putrified and cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5375:57"/> qualities, ſo there are alſo ſome medicines, which thorow their lenetiue nature paſſe ouer into the ſubſtance of the body.</p>
               <p>Ther is alſo an other cauſe in the vniuerſall participation of ioyning ſuperiour cauſes together, into one perfect ſubſtance is ſo duly regarded in them, as that their qualitie in action hath no domination in it ſelfe, but their properties are rather deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and brought downe from the ſtarres into the power of hearbes. Otherwiſe this wandring deſert hearbe Scanmiony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, which vnperfectly purgeth choller, and leaueth the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the body in more worſe eſtate then before, ſhould be as familiar to the body, as Succorie, Endiffe, Bugloſſe, and ſuch like hearbes of ſaluing and curing nature. And yet <hi>Dyoſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> ſaith, that Succory is of diuers kindes: one is cheriſhed in Gardens as a pretious treaſure, preſerued for bodilie health, ſo the other is wilde and of more reſiſting vertue. Yet becauſe they doo both alike drawe a naturall power from the ſtarres, in one perfect kind and ſubſtance, doo equally agree in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of operation: for they are ſo indicible and euident, as that their propertie is not knowne onely by reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is alſo an hearbe called Molios, which draweth a power from the high gouernour of Spirites, called <hi>Amy,</hi> and hath ſixteene legions vnder his dominion, as <hi>Dyoſcori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> reporteth in his third booke, and the fiftie two chapters in the Commentes of <hi>Barbarus,</hi> and <hi>Virgilius,</hi> that this hearbe is of an outward vertue moſt excellent, it hath great power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt witchcraft, ſouth ſaieng, and coniuration: it is not inward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be taken, but outwardly to bee caried about: it is of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie by it ſelfe, and wil not inwardly be changed into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of mans nature, neither doeth it preuaile in remedy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſe, except the falling ſickneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:5375:58"/>
               <p>And ſurely, all other hearbs haue ſome naturall or vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall portion, with our bodie. Yet it is vnpoſſibly, that they ſhould be of one power and effect together, neither is there a like alteration one with an other: For if their properties were of equall agreement, then one ſubſtance could not haue equall operation into an other.</p>
               <p>Euen as theſe prrperties doo verie much diſagree within themſelues, ſo can they not foorthwith paſſe ouer into mutuall ſubſtance of mans bodie, without artful knowledge, aptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them thereto. As fire ſodainly without art, can not bee traſformed into water, nor ayre into earth.</p>
               <p>So by the ſame difference medicines are diſtinguiſhed and and knowen from nouriſhments. For as nouriſhmentys agree with the natural comfortes of men, ſo medicines haue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, differing from the properties of men. And as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are repugnant to the diſeaſe, ſo both the body and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe not onely become ſubiect, but refourmed to medicine, for health and ſafetie thereby. And although Art domifieth them, to become gentle, kinde, and naturall: yet art neuer depriueth them from their free propertie: For how much the rather they are of contrarie ſubſtance, ſo doo they ſhew themſelues the rather in the ſimilitude of a more greater action: and yet for that one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is paſſed ouer into an other, they are qualified alſo in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: therefore let vs once againe diſtinguiſh the eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of medicines within themſelues.</p>
               <p>Although there is an artificiall forme in the conſtitution of all medicines, framed to ſome ſpeciall appointed purpoſe, yet as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, there are ſome hearbes colde, which take a verye litle portion of change in the heate of mans blood: And many times, not onely becauſe they are of colde nature, but venomed in ſome degree of poiſon, very notably do they corrupt mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: As the mandragoron and ſuch like.

               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:5375:58"/>
               <p>There are alſo medicines, neither of hurting nor ſaluing power, neither of hote nor cold operation, neither doe they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh nor yet deſtroy, but very indifferent to the body of man.</p>
               <p>There are alſo compoſed medicines of honnie, butter, ſweet oyle, as they are not of no pure nor cleere verdoue, ſo are they verie nouriſhable and reſtauratiue to nature: And as nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes are eaſily changed into nature, ſo the power of all other medicines doe comprehend a worke in their owne properties, and therefore it is impoſſible, their power ſhould be both kept and changed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth make further report, that ſo long as medicines doe continue their nature and degree, vnder the equall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body, are not onely gentle and fauourably incertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but changed into bloud with the nature of the body: are no more vnder the compaſſe of medicines, but rather followe the due courſe of vegetation, preſeruation and ſimpathie, with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall operation, both in qualitie and power of the body.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Galen</hi> hath extended his reaſons to hote medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I know not, but I feare not to ſpeake, that oftentimes both hote and cold medicines are vnder one propertie turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud, when as the body meanely is ſubdued with coldneſſe from the extremitie of heat, and aduaunced to heat, from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of coldneſſe: for then is it impoſſible that any impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, ſhould at all remaine, where many properties are duely changed.</p>
               <p>And alſo it is a moſt hard and difficult eſtate, if ſubſtance in the nature of euerie one thing, ſhould whollie be taken away or diminiſhed, ſo neyther then, is any ſuche bloud left alone to doe good in abſolute power: for humours, doe nouriſh themſelues, where good bloud wanteth.

So likewiſe in ſommer ſeaſon, ſome bodies, by eating of cold Lattice are drawne to ouer great comminution, and heate, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and bloud are many times extenuated, weakened and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5375:59"/> in their due courſe. Let euery one therefore moſt highly call to memorie, that meaſure and moderation are much pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferred vnder the conſtitution of mans health.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thruſianus</hi> an old fatherly writer (as one falfly perſwaded) doth ſay, that nothing is caryed, or conueyed beyond the heate of mans body, and that bodily heat congruently conſenteth to all forraine heates, being of neuer ſo ſtrong and high valour: and ſaith further, that ſingle medicines cannot be changed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their owne nature. The which wrongfull opinion and iudgement hee ſeemeth to conſent with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that euerie thing is borne and brought foorth into this world, to aduouch his owne propertie in the actuall accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of ſome effectuall vertue, for the helpe or hinderance of an other thing. And yet this nothing proueth why any qualitie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of heate or bloud ſhould be aduaunced beyond his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except by ſome inforced extremitie: or except only becauſe the maner of dyet, is more ſtronger in one body then another: or except ſome bodies are diſpoſed to feede vpon groſſer ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then another: for that body doth inioy and obtaine grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt health which feedeth vppon the pureſt, cleereſt and moſt choyſe ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>Surely as the body begetteth his portion of heate after the greatneſſe, maner and meetneſſe of ſuſtenance, ſo warmeneſſe of bloud, equallie either by tenuitie, indifferencie, or fulneſſe, is matched and aduaunced with the bodie: but the office of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not herewith compared, hauing no naturall indowment of heate from the affluence of heate, and bloud in the body.</p>
               <p>There is a conſtitution of variable humours by the ſame temperance of the liuer, vnder which one is more colder then the liuer it ſelfe, and the other more hotter after the condition of ſome materiall cauſe, from whence the heate of the liuer is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, eſpecially for that nothing is ſo ſingle in nature, but that it is variably altered by the heate of the ſunne: ſo that ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in the variable diſpoſition of man are like vnto waxe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, or clay hardned by the vertue and ſtrength of the ſunne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> reporteth, that the complexion of euerie man draweth vpon the ſunne, and the grace of the ſunne hath a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:5375:59"/> action vpon all ſeuerall thinges variable, being compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it ſelfe: and that euerie man is diſpoſed alter the foure orders of the elementes. So that ſome men are white, ſome men blacke, ſome men red, ſome of one colour, ſome of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, thereby <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith that herein may be perceiued that all heates feede vpon the ſunne. And furthermore doth ſay, that like as fire is ſtroke from the hardneſſe, and ſecret vaynes of the flint, ſo the liuer is fed and nouriſhed by an intentiue hote hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour inforced from the ſunne. For which cauſe and after this maner nouriſhment ſubtilly and moſte ſecretly paſſeth into the naturall heate of mans body, chiefly when nature ioyneth in propertie therewith.</p>
               <p>So nouriſhment nothing diſagreeth from wood ioyned vnto fire, which firſt ſtandeth at a ſtate, then preſently altereth into the nature of fire, and becommeth into one perfect ſubſtance therewith. And as heate is more weake in one body then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo heate according to the copiouſneſſe of ſuſtenance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth throoughout the whole body: And heat alſo more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily flameth out after the conſtitution of a hot, high, and ſtrong ſuſtenance, then by a cold, thinne and weake dyet. And therfore foode ought with care and diligence to be wayed and regarded, both for the preſeruation of mans life, as alſo for that ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are thorow euill regiment eaſier corrupted and ouertaken then others.</p>
               <p>Then haue we iuſt cauſe to thinke that heate is not properly nouriſhed of anie propertie in it ſelfe, but either violently drawn from ſome other inferiour and naturall cauſes of fire, or els from the ſupernaturall comfort of the ſunne, which is the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of all inferiour cauſes, to become with them of one parmanent and firme operation.</p>
               <p>Surely then nouriſhment is receiued into the body by three maner of meanes: as firſt, when an exceſſe quantitie of dyet is receiued into the body, bringeth forth ſome monſirous or vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition in it ſelfe: And ſuch ſtrange diſpoſitions will not conſent euer after, to follow the right direction of perfect nouriſhment. As wine although it be of excellent qualitie, and moſt eaſily retayned and digeſted downe into the body, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:5375:60"/> receiued by exceſſe quantitie, oftentimes doth benumme and ouercoole naturall temperance, and doth of it ſelfe conuert into cold humours, by ſome ſtrange alteration, for that not onely the aboundance therof confoundeth heat, and the verdour being ouer charged by a ſurfetting diſtemperance, oppreſſeth both the power of heate and nouriſhment, and altogether therewithall ſurpriſeth bodily conſtitution.</p>
               <p>There may be alſo wayed a conſideration in the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, how nouriſhment altereth and tranſferreth it ſelfe. For while it continueth, the ſtomacke hath the onely effect of foode: but being digeſted from the ſtomacke paſſeth from one office to another, vntill the ſubſtance, ſtrength and power thereof, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, conuerted and altered, to become of one vnion in mans body: and when the body is vnapt to intertaine perfect nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, both ſheweth a degeneration of nature, and the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of the body reclined to ſome forraine contagion.</p>
               <p>There is an abſolute comprehenſion in the third degree, which is moſte perfect both to health, long life and the naturall ſubſtance of man, that is, when meate moſt ſufficiently brooketh mans body, and the body taketh good liking and reliſhe of the meate, are foorthwith reſembled into one ſimilitude toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>And yet there are foure degrees, which are called ſecond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities, beſides foure humours which participate vpon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The firſt cauſe is contained vnder the ſubtile vaines and arteries: and therefore becauſe heate is not onely degenerated, but ſetled and concocted in a corrupt bloud, there is a plaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of nature, and all moyſtneſſe doe waxe thinne thereby.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree of theſe Humidities, is when a diſperſed due interfloweth from ſuſtenance, into all the partes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, the which if by alteration of ſtrange humours it falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to corruption, is the onely efficient cauſe of a third humiditie, and no nouriſhment is fauourable vnto the body, and all glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous<note place="margin">Exanguit, that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloud.</note> cauſes are quite ſeparated from the body, by meanes it is exanguit, conſumpted, and quite deuoyded from heat: yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but that there is ſome clammie matter impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon the loonges, which gnaweth vpon the deſire of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:5375:60"/> alwayes belonging to ſuch humid diſeaſes. The fourth humidity repreſenteth a hungrie nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> in his ſixt booke in the cauſes of Symptomatickes doth ſay, that although they haue diuers names, yet are they of one ſharpe hurtfull operation in nouriſhment, except that which maketh ſome delay either in the ſtomach or in the maw, &amp; that the vaines may extract a mouing comfort therefrom.</p>
               <p>And alſo we muſt vnderſtand, that this nouriſhment extendeth to the extreame partes. Otherwiſe truelie in my opinion, other parts need not to contract nor trauell with the ſtomach and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for moyſture to their better nouriſhment. Al which perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth that nature draweth a potentiall ſubſtance for the ſtrength of nouriſhment: and the more nearer there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſubſtance in all the partes of the bodie, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier is there a returne of nouriſhment, except it otherwiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth by meanes of any forraine accidence. For ſowes fleſh, although it hath great affinitie and nearneſſe with mans fleſh, yet by the good operation of wine, it is paſſed ouer into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſubſtance, and the digeſtion thereof is ſlowe, ſower, and heauie, for becauſe the vnion hereof is of a more thicke and growne ſubſtance, it is operatiue and ouerburthenſome, then familiar, vſuall and accuſtomed. Therefore the power of hotte thinges, haue a double difference, for which cauſe ther are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of on operation, and nouriſhmentes of an other, the which nouriſhmentes ought to haue an eaſie gracious nature, eyther to helpe nature decaied, or to pacifie the troubles of any diſeaſe offending wholſom conſtitution, doo iuſtifie and continue the health and ſafegard of the bodie, are preferred before all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and nature the more graciouſly, and eaſily dooth accept them to bee placed in ſome due ordinance with the body. For ſuch like nutritiue medicines, as they haue an inward mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng operation, ſo haue they an outward application. And yet ſome, according to the demonſtration of <hi>Galen</hi> doo thinke that nutritiue medicines inwardly taken, hauing poſſeſſed and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their heat, vnder the fourme of a hot complexion, are of moore greater force and ſtrength, and ſuch medicines are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:5375:61"/> reduced, and manifeſted in their owne nature and propertie more quicklie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, that medicines outwardly miniſtred more ſpeedily doo ſhew their nature, then thoſe which be inwardly intertained, eſpecially if in their action they be hotte and firme: and although vnder the ſkinne are more inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye tender, then is outwardly ſhewed, yet haue they a more ready dutie hereby, to ſearch the deepneſſe of the wound, and gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Probleames (ſpeaking of viniger and ſuch like ſharpe ſauces) dooth ſay, that the aſwell inward, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward applications, very ſenſibly doo freate, and if heat bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed of a more ſtronger power in the pacient, dooth growe to an inward exceſſe, and outwardlie offendeth: yet a ſtrong and hot body will eaſily and verie much blunt and dull the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hereof. As firſt, by extenuation and comminution. Secondly, by concoction, and thirdly by motion, for that they are rouing, neuer continuing themſelues in one eſtate, but diſpoſe them ſelues into al other partes. As fourthly by ſeperation, eſpecially of thoſe partes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are more ſharpe, as prepared, purged and ſifted either by fluring, either by vrine, or vomite and breathing vapours from the ſtomach, rather then of thoſe parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which are more calme, ſound, bening and bountifull. In which it is to be marked whether nature be impaired, in the excluſion of one part more then an other, or remaineth wholly, ſound, and perfect. Alſo whether the blood bee made cleare and kindly by a freſh and newe coiunction. Alſo whether the rind and barke of the vaines be wrinkled, dimiſhed, and broken in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and whether medicine haue a naturall power to vnite, and conioine in the nature of the body, for if the medicine be blunted and dulled by the ſtrength of the body, then the body is vtterlie vnable to defend it ſelfe from corruption, but preſentlie infected
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5375:61"/> with all kind of vlceration. And theſe kind of vlcers are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended either from ranke aboundaunce of melancholious corruption ariſing betweene the fleſh and the ſkinne into ſome outward prepoſterous ſore, or els moſt commonly by reaſon of ſome hotte fluxing humour vnnaturally ſetling in ſome part of the body, wherein ſome vnkindly worme breedeth and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eateth, except ſome preſent ſtay and remedy be had, And <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith there are diuers ſortes breeding in their kind according to the nature and diſpoſition of the body.</p>
               <p>And although the Chirurgians do giue them ſeueral names yet they ought not ſo to doo, becauſe they are wormes gathered and miſhapen according to the monſtrouſneſſe of the humour, and neuer continue in one kind.</p>
               <p>And yet ſome olde writers deuide theſe ſortes of ſores into foure names: <hi>Herpes, Phagedina, Chironia,</hi> and <hi>Telephia,</hi> The firſt is of verie affinitie with a plague ſore. The ſecond is ſome filthy blacke worme, or Fyſtula fretting betweene the fleſh and the bones. The third is a foule ſore, hard to be cured, and being poiſoned with the melancholiouſneſſe of the humour is called, <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> The fourth complecteth it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of all Boyles or Carbunckles: and ſurly al ſharp, ſower, ſwift, ſtyffe and cruell medicines, whether they be hotte, or colde, haue in themſelues a naturall poyſon to doe hurt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And they are more harmefull beeing eaten, then when they be outwardly applyed, for in their nature, they do not only intoxicate the primary partes of man, but deepely pearce the power of the heart.</p>
               <p>We haue a manifeſt and rare example of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in ſtrong power of health, except by drinking that daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and murtherſome hear be Cicuta, who ſenſiblie feeling the coldnes and power thereof to inſinuate and wind it ſelfe, did vanquiſh the highneſſe and mightines of his heart: confeſſed that Cicuta was the ſting of death, and the venym of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> diſcribeth this hearbe Cycuta, to be both in nature and growth, like to our engliſh Henilocke.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe medicines do litle hurt being outwardly applied,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5375:62"/> but they are poiſonſome and deadly, being inwardly taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſmall quantitie thereof be ſuch, as that the body bee of ſtronger power to vanquiſh and ſhake off the mortalitie thereof.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a certain ioyce nowe in vſe, ſtrained &amp; ſqueaſed out of the leaues of Laſcrpitium. <hi>Antonius Muſa</hi> ſaith, it is the gum of the tree it ſelfe called Roſen, or Belſwyn, and Bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyn.</p>
               <p>There is no difference whether it proceed of the ioyce, or weeping teares and licour of the tree.

               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:5375:62"/>
               <p>Now to returne to our purpoſe in the naturall cauſes of cold and heate, for that there was neuer anie able to ſhewe the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of colde and heate in one like qualitie of the ſame. And who was euer able to draw, the ſtrength of hote cauſes to take effect, from mans naturall heate? Or who was euer able, or yet would bring to paſſe, that cold thinges ſhould take their action of colde and heate in one like degree, from mans naturall heate? Except in ſuffocating the ſences vtterly thereby. For cold medicines do in their owne propertie and nature follow their owne ſtrength and qualitie in the bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> proueth by the example of cold water, which if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſted with an accidentall heate, will by potentiall eſſence in it ſelfe, returne to a naturall propertie of coldneſſe. For as water hath a ſecret interflowing from the vaines of the earth, which although it hath ſome ſecret heate by vapours, or the influent exhalations of the elementes, aſcending and diſcending, yet is it in propertie altogether cold, without alteration, and therefore it is to be regarded that hote fire is extinguiſhed and put out with ſcalding water, ſo medicines many times haue an action of heate, yet of their potentiall power they doe ouercoole and infrefe the body.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is another degree of medicines of cold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which although they be altered by art, to become of a more hote power, yet doe they returne to the former firſt frigiditie, yet altogether without excellencie in it ſelfe. So water doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne alwaies to a peculiar and naturall coldneſſe. Therefore if medicines be miniſtred in anie degree to the body, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall doe congeale and extreame with coldneſſe, it is done in the propertie and nature of medicine, not becauſe they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred beyond their accuſtomed action.</p>
               <p>Now it is further to be inquired, whether medicines in the fourth degree, dronke vnder euident coldneſſe, may in anie ſort be quite tranſlated from the naturall heate of man. For that it doth not much appertaine to our queſtion, wee will not much here diſpute with <hi>Galen,</hi> neither is it a matter of anie impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or waight.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but if theſe cold medicines be in ſmall
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5375:63"/> quantitie proffered vpon anie diſtemperance of the body, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape altogether the worke of nature, but therewithall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth the bodie. For like as medicines framed and compoſed of fumitorie, much preuaile in helpe of the dropſie, ſo the diſeaſe called Hydros, that is, when the ſkinne is filled with water, is preſently cured with blacke popie. And <hi>Galen</hi> ſomewhat tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in conſcience, practiſeth to waſh away his former obiection againſt the preparation of popie, ſeemeth to admit the vſe thereof againſt thoſe hote vlcerations, ſo it be both artificially tempered and naturally compoſed with the complexion.</p>
               <p>Then ſuch medicines are not in ſame quantitie alwaies ſo deepelie foreſet with cold, but that they may haue ſome naturall inſtinct of heate, eſpecially ſuch hearbes which are in the ſecond and third degree colde, and may not altogether reiect and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe themſelues from the ſtrength of heate: So doe they eaſily conuert themſelues to become in vnion with bodily heate, and their wholeſome kindly temperance, quietly, ſecretly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ſubdueth and appeaſeth all extreame diſtemperances of heate in the bodie.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> on the contrarie affirmeth, that <hi>Galen</hi> is herein greatly deceiued. For he further ſayth that cold medicines haue a priuate and effectuall nature of cooling and intertained into the body, as poſſibly to be indured, vntill it be regenerat with bodily heate. <hi>Paracelſus</hi> reaſon herein is, for that heate and cold may in both their properties obtaine a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtinction: as either are they to do ſome effect in their own properties, or els by accidentall meanes, the which hath bene ſufficiently handled in the former books of theſe temperaments eſpecially in the qualities of dry and moyſt thinges.</p>
               <p>We may finde out ſufficient ſimilitudes and teſtimonies of cold and hote things, as popie being of cold nature, ſo Henbane is of ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>So likewiſe if Celledin be dronke in naturall kindneſſe of it
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:5375:63"/> ſelfe, much profiteth the body, but being receiued into the body by an accidentall heate, doe greatly hurt and diſtemper the vital parts of man, not ſo much in reſpect of action as of operation. And certainly, as there may be a tranſlation of all thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond nature. So oyle is not ſimply called hote, becauſe it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a flame of fire, but becauſe it hath a natural and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heate in it ſelfe. For ſurely hote nouriſhmentes, although they be put into the bodie in the nature of fire, yet are they no fire: for ſuch kinde of nouriſhmentes are oftentimes to profite the body in place of medicines, and yet the ſame traſferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the common courſe of temperance, diſprofiteth and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth the body. I would haue it to be heere vnderſtoode, that whatſoeuer altereth the diſeaſe is a medicine, except onely that meate and ſuſtenance which aduaunceth it ſelfe beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon temperance: otherwiſe all foode miniſtred vnto the bodie ſhould be medicinable, ſheweth ſome naturall effect eyther of liking or diſliking propertie. For ſome are of equall power to comfort and nouriſh the body, ſome doe alter the body to ſome vnkindly diſtemperance, ſome doe purge the bodie, ſome do ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet the body, and ſome doe poyſon the body. We may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore coniecture, that all ſortes of meates, ſuffered in the body are medicines, but we muſt certainly perſwade our ſelues that all purgations miniſtred vnto the body, are poyſon ſome for preſent operation, although not deadly: for purgatiue medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are of three natures. In their firſt nature, lenitiuely doe approue and molifie the body: In their ſecond propertie, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently doe ſearch and ſtrongly feede vpon the body. They doe in their third propertie, inſume nature, vtterly oppreſſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by a ſharpe aduſt fluxing of bloud, or cls a deadly benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the vitall partes.</p>
               <p>As all naturall ſuſtenance agreeing with the body, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the ſubſtance of fleſh and bloud, ſo all poyſons of what condition ſoeuer they be, after they be chaſtiſed from their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonſome malice, are moſt curable antidotes, and remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all venims and ſtenchfull corruptions, which eyther of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or ouercharge the wholeſome eſtate of mans life. Yet <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth that whoſoeuer drinketh iuyce of the vyper or
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:5375:64"/> aſpes, is deadly poyſoned, can neuer be healed, nor the poyſon thereof ſubdued, corrected or ſurpriſed, by any art in man. Yet <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> ſayth, that the ſtone taken from the corſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, of ſome ancient king, after hee hath bene long dead, is a ſpeciall remedie againſt the poyſon of vyper or aſpes, and all other poyſons in the higheſt degre.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> calleth euerie diſtemperate action (in propertie) dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion, that is venomous, to which hee rehearſeth two ſeuerall kindes of hote and colde poyſons as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> reporteth that the natures of poyſons, are of ſondrie degrees to mans body: And this contrarietie not onely reſpecteth a moſt miſchieuous operation for a peculiar qualitie in it ſelfe, but hath alſo an indicible propertie in his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which is not onely contrary, vncertaine and gathered from the moſt diſtemperat influences aboue, but of the moſte contagious vaporations beneath, all which eaſily is knowne by a certaine ordinary mutation going betweene: ſo that all thoſe which continently doe not paſſe ouer in agreement with nature, are contrarie in their power to bodily ſubſtance, although they doe in eyther qualitie diſagree. As manie of theſe vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall poyſons, are within themſelues, of one proper qualitie, ſo manie of them are of two qualities, one diſagreeing from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and yet are they not contrarie in their ſeueall operatiue malice.</p>
               <p>There are on the other ſide, many poyſons which in their owne proper qualities reſiſt againe, and yet in their kinde are not contrarie: therefore ſome extraordinarie mutation may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and correct this onely contrarietie.</p>
               <p>Yet I doe greatly maruell that <hi>Auycen</hi> holdeth opinion, that all colde poyſons are whollie contrarie to mans nature, in their kinde and propertie, as that they may not be corrected, or delayed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> reporteth, that an olde wife of Athens, made a contrarie experience hereof, tranſmuting the heath Cicuta, by litle and litle without danger agreeable to purge her owne nature. And <hi>Galen</hi> in his third booke of Simples the xxi. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth ſay, that all cold poyſons, ſhewe their venome not in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5375:64"/> nature, but in quantitie, neither can they be altered from their malignitie, nor yet paſſe ouer into ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, this opinion is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, neither can it be true, that poiſonſome medicines obtain their force, rather from powerfull quantitie, then actiue malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for the force of colde poyſons beeing loſte vnder the action of heate, manifeſtly doe infrigerate the body, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more notablie diſcouered, then if colde water being made of an accidentall heat, from a former propertie of cold, not onely returneth to nature, but becommeth more colder, then before.</p>
               <p>So whoſoeuer drinketh cold medicines, being drawen into accidentall heate, do in their operation return to former proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not onely alter, in their owne power, but are preferred to a more greater manifeſtation. For oftentimes colde fieame is ſo diſcerned, as if the vrine be thicke and clammie by contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, or by ſome forraine corruption, hath an vſurping acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of heat, which although natural medicine hath ſome ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue inclinatio, nyet there may be a texgiuer ſation to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propertie and power of coldneſſe, and thereby oftentimes greatly offend vs, except the ſtrength of our nature ouertrauell the danger thereof, or that the quantitie be ſmall, or becauſe litle heat is obtained and gotten in the vertue thereof, is the more eaſier deiected.</p>
               <p>We haue an example of the Salamander, who hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall propertie of fire, and yet beeing of extreame naturall power of coldneſſe, extinguiſheth and quencheth all fire. Euen ſo this hearbe Cycuta and ſuch like vnconſtant poyſons, haue an outward affynitie with fire: yet the practiſe thereof benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the moſt perfect heat of the body, to become vncertaine and wauering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> affyrmeth, that although artificiall practiſe ſhould delay this hearbe Cycuta to worke in a moderat proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet wil it returne to a former affliction and euill diſpoſition in it ſelfe: Which eaſily may be perceiued, in that al cold poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are of contrary natures to hot poiſons. So both of them are two dangerous contrarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es to the ſubſtance of the body: as alſo ſuch medicines which work beyond common courſe are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:5375:65"/> poiſons, and all ſuch medicines which haſten the diſeaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſwift, ſharp, and inſult the ſpirituall partes are po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And all ſuch medicines which diſgrace the diſeaſe, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and of high condignitie with nature. And all ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines whith purely frame and vnite with the body, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſeruations for the helpe, both of health and long life to the bodie.</p>
               <p>Therefore in miniſtring of medicines, there is both an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and an extraordinarie compoſition: miniſtration and operation. For medicines are rather framed of an actiue, then paſſiue nature. As Pepper or Muſtard ſeede are actiue: ſo wine and honnie are paſſiue in operation.</p>
               <p>Alſo there be other ſimples of doubtfull propertie in their worke. As the Lettuce, which although Galen commendeth the propertie thereof, to bee wholſome againſt the heate of the the ſtomach, yet <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> reporteth, that it hath an energiecall worke to moderate, coole, and ſeaſon the body in the middeſt of hotte infectious diſeaſes, but neither <hi>Valerius Cordus,</hi> neither the Pande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, nor yet the Luminarie make any ſuch rehearſall.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Petrus Galienſis</hi> ſaith, that both the Lettuce, and hearbes of ſuch like vertue, drawe vpon the north Pole: as ſome more nearer, and ſome farther off, and therefore in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they exceede one an other. And ſaith, all hearbes whoſe properties are leuied from the ſouth hot, are mitigated, meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and equally compounded by an increment of the north <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind.</p>
               <p>And he further ſaith, that all ſingle hearbes, worke after the coaſtes of the elementes: except hearbes of cold propertie, which of themſelues haue no elemental attraction, the Fuſun notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath a ſingular conflexion vpon them. And although it was before ſpoken in the firſt booke of theſe Temperaments that the Sun ſplendeth or diminiſheth her force vpon all liuing creatures, yet there muſt bee vnderſtood, that the Sun hath a permanent reflection in her owne power and nature, but onely that the heat of the Sun is ſtyrred and prouoked to be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength in ſommer by meanes of certaine hot planets,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:5375:65"/> which then haue ſpeciall domination in the elementes. So on the contrarie, the coldneſſe of the elements in winter doo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and infeeble the heat, and yet the ſunne hath one like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er both in winter and ſommer: ſo that as the ſunne arriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Then are we rightlie to coniecture, that the hearbes of the field attract from the elements an operatiue power in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall eſtate of mans health: for the hearbe Peperites hath a wonderfull and excellent operation, againſt the commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So alſo there is an other hearbe called <hi>Scopa Regia,</hi> which draweth a moſt high dignitie from a ſtarre, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the newe moone, called <hi>Occulus Lunae,</hi> and is of right vertue to heale a ſwelling congeſled blood in the throat, called the kinges euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Petrus Galienſis</hi> ſaith, the hearbe Dragon is of cold opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and draweth a vertue from the Lode ſtar. The heate of the Sun without difference warmeth all thinges, yet in deeper pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration of one thing more then another.</p>
               <p>Herewithall it is a moſt excellent thing to conſider the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of Honie: the which honie is reſpected to be in the vſe of man in one degree, and in the vſe of a Bee in an other degree. For as the heate of the Sun is ſincere and pure in nature and propertie, ſo dooth it conioine with the courſe of ſtarres diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by a certaine mellifluous dewe, inſeaſeth it ſelfe vpon the hearbs of the earth by attraction. Neither is it of right iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this hony, is naturall &amp; indifferent to all the hearbs of the earth, although the Bee hath a generall portion thorowout. Therfore <hi>Dyoſcorides</hi> ſaith, that the naturall Bee ſucketh the moſt mellifluous fruites of the earth. But the vnnaturall Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roueth and rangeth aſwell vpon the one as the other, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally all wilde and ſauage weedes.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:5375:66"/>
               <p>And yet as the Magnet or Lode-ſtone is vnforceable to attract vppon euerye complexion, ſo all ſortes of hearbes are not drawen from the Elementes: for theyr attractiue apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe many times fall out diuerſly, after the complection of men. For as there be hearbes of thin and light operation, ſo there are thin and light humours in men. And as there be thick and groſſe operations in hearbes, ſo are there alſo thicke and groſſe humours in men. Therefore the power of hot thinges, may not be adiudged by touching, neither yet vnderſtood by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, for that al things are diuers in operation. For as hot things are not alwaies thin and light, ſo thicke things are not alwaies cold: yet doth it commonly fall out, that ſolutiue medicines are alwaies hot, ſharpe, and bitter. But we may not iuſtlie affirme that all ſweet medicines are hot, for that bitter medicines are ſhadowed many times with outward ſweetnes, As <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith <hi>Sub melle venenum tegitur.</hi> Surely al hot things are of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till extenuation, and yet oftentimes through a hotte ſubſtance in themſelues, doo growe into ſleſhie thickneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hypocrates</hi> reporteth his helpe towardes a yoong man which was ouergrowen with fleſhie thickneſſe both of bellie and other partes of his bodie, did aboundantlie waſh, bath, and ſoke himſelfe in the middeſt of ſommer in colde water: And whereas chieflie his face, and other partes of his body were ſtyffened, thickened and bound with cold humours, and for the exceeding thickneſſe of his ſkinne, the deflation of heate was repreſſed, foorthwith a righteous experience tooke a prooffe. For that, freſh vnion and naturall collection of heate did follow.</p>
               <p>This excellent temperance followeth the elementes by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural repercuſſion of all cold temperatures, into the ſweete and medicionable ſpringes of the earth: for that the hot ſommer courſe, in the Elementes hath repreſſed all colde tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of morning dewes, into the vaines and hart of the earth, the water ſpringes become thereby potatiue, wholeſome and medicionable, and both within, as without the bodie of high operation. For now as the increaſe of heate is hereby ſtyrred
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:5375:66"/> vp, ſo alſo the exteame coldneſſe, and ouer great thickneſſe of the ſkinne, conceiueth a free relaxation in the poores, whereas alſo both the bloud and breath were inwardly repulſed, ſo the one freely interfloweth the vaines, and the other hath a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and equall propertie from the loonges. And alſo the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which were before halfe ſetled, doe become nowe more plentifull and are perfected into a regular order, and heate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with regenerated, doth firſt ſpring vp and forthwith returne and ſtrike backe againe, thereby at length heate ouercommeth colde in the extreame and vttermoſt partes, and permanently there doth ſettle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> doth ſeeme to call this repercuſſion, onely the ſame repulſion, which is made after the concoction of humours. Neither is it to be maruelled if heate heereby, returne more plentifull, both becauſe the bloud being increaſed and renewed, the heate alſo muſt of neceſſitie be increaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophraſtus Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, I doe eſteeme heate to be borne out more euident and manifeſt to outward things by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie repercuſſions, although no increaſe of bloud ſhall follow in outward thinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for certain momentanie repercuſſions may hinder bloud anie more to bend, yet it may not be ſaid, that the cauſe thereof hapneth in the ripeneſſe of vnperfect humours. For this cauſe doth it ſeeme to come to paſſe after this maner, that bloud cannot eaſily be drawne, when it is chaſed from the outward plentie and fulneſſe, vncertainly to poſſeſſe the inward partes: after which beeing againe inforced to anie outward operation, draweth a portion of humours to purſue thoſe vaynes euer after, as the old prouerbe is. <hi>Fluxus, fluxum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore it is a moſte excellent ornament to beholde the ſignes of the elementes in all euacuations.
